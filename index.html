In recent years, many programmes have been launched to increase the uptake of different vaccines in adolescent populations; however, vaccination coverage among adolescents remains suboptimal. Therefore, understanding and evaluating the various interventions that can be used to improve adolescent vaccination is crucial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of interventions to improve vaccine uptake among adolescents. SEARCH METHODS: In October 2018, we searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, and eight other databases. In addition, we searched two clinical trials platforms, electronic databases of grey literature, and reference lists of relevant articles. For related systematic reviews, we searched four databases. Furthermore, in May 2019, we performed a citation search of five other websites. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies of adolescents (girls or boys aged 10 to 19 years) eligible for World Health Organization-recommended vaccines and their parents or healthcare providers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened records, reviewed full-text articles to identify potentially eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, resolving discrepancies by consensus. For each included study, we calculated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate. We pooled study results using random-effects meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 studies (eight individually randomised trials, four cluster randomised trials, three non-randomised trials, and one controlled before-after study). Twelve studies were conducted in the USA, while there was one study each from: Australia, Sweden, Tanzania, and the UK. Ten studies had unclear or high risk of bias. We categorised interventions as recipient-oriented, provider-oriented, or health systems-oriented. The interventions targeted adolescent boys or girls or both (seven studies), parents (four studies), and providers (two studies). Five studies had mixed participants that included adolescents and parents, adolescents and healthcare providers, and parents and healthcare providers. The outcomes included uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) (11 studies); hepatitis B (three studies); and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular-pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal, HPV, and influenza (three studies) vaccines among adolescents. Health education improves HPV vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.76; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1054 participants; high-certainty evidence). In addition, one large study provided evidence that a complex multi-component health education intervention probably results in little to no difference in hepatitis B vaccine uptake compared to simplified information leaflets on the vaccine (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99; 17,411 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Financial incentives may improve HPV vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.99; 1 study, 500 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain whether combining health education and financial incentives has an effect on hepatitis B vaccine uptake, compared to usual practice (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.00; 1 study, 104 participants; very low certainty evidence). Mandatory vaccination probably leads to a large increase in hepatitis B vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 3.92, 95% CI 3.65 to 4.20; 1 study, 6462 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Provider prompts probably make little or no difference compared to usual practice, on completion of Tdap (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.80; 2 studies, 3296 participants), meningococcal (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.79; 2 studies, 3219 participants), HPV (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.81; 2 studies, 859 participants), and influenza (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34; 2 studies, 1439 participants) vaccination schedules (moderate-certainty evidence). Provider education with performance feedback may increase the proportion of adolescents who are offered and accept HPV vaccination by clinicians, compared to usual practice. Compared to adolescents visiting non-participating clinicians (in the usual practice group), the adolescents visiting clinicians in the intervention group were more likely to receive the first dose of HPV during preventive visits (5.7 percentage points increase) and during acute visits (0.7 percentage points for the first and 5.6 percentage points for the second doses of HPV) (227 clinicians and more than 200,000 children; low-certainty evidence). A class-based school vaccination strategy probably leads to slightly higher HPV vaccine uptake than an age-based school vaccination strategy (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.13; 1 study, 5537 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A multi-component provider intervention (including an education session, repeated contacts, individualised feedback, and incentives) probably improves uptake of HPV vaccine compared to usual practice (moderate-certainty evidence). A multi-component intervention targeting providers and parents involving social marketing and health education may improve HPV vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.59; 1 study, 25,869 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Various strategies have been evaluated to improve adolescent vaccination including health education, financial incentives, mandatory vaccination, and class-based school vaccine delivery. However, most of the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. This implies that while this research provides some indication of the likely effect of these interventions, the likelihood that the effects will be substantially different is high. Therefore, additional research is needed to further enhance adolescent immunisation strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries where there are limited adolescent vaccination programmes. In addition, it is critical to understand the factors that influence hesitancy, acceptance, and demand for adolescent vaccination in different settings. This is the topic of an ongoing Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis, which may help to explain why and how some interventions were more effective than others in increasing adolescent HPV vaccination coverage.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Abdullahi LH ; Kagina BM ; Ndze VN ; Hussey GD ; Wiysonge CS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nChild\r\nControlled Before-After Studies\r\nHealth Education/*methods\r\nHealth Personnel/education\r\nHumans\r\nParents/education\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVaccination/*statistics & numerical data/trends","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Abdullahi LH, Kagina BM, Ndze VN, Hussey GD, and Wiysonge CS (2020) Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents..

In fact, primary prevention of the infection corresponds to primary prevention of HPV-related cancers and other diseases. Since an effective prevention at the population level is the final goal, it is mandatory for healthcare systems to achieve a high HPV vaccination coverage among the adolescents to reduce the circulation of the virus and the burden of HPV-related diseases. This research identified, through a systematic literature review, 38 papers on strategies adopted to increase HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents. The evaluated strategies targeted adolescents/parents and/or healthcare providers and could be grouped in three main types: (1) reminder-based, (2) education, information, and communication activities, and (3) multicomponent strategies. Several types of strategy, such as those relied only on reminders and integrating different interventions, showed a positive impact on vaccination coverage. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity of the interventions suggests the importance to adapt such strategies to the specific national/local contexts to maximize vaccination coverage.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Acampora A ; Grossi A ; Barbara A ; Colamesta V ; Causio FA ; Calabrò GE ; Boccia S ; de Waure C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Personnel\r\nHumans\r\n*Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control\r\n*Papillomavirus Vaccines\r\n*Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control/virology\r\nVaccination\r\nVaccination Coverage\r\nHPV vaccination\r\nincreasing coverage\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Acampora A, Grossi A, Barbara A, Colamesta V, Causio FA, Calabrò GE, Boccia S, and de Waure C (2020) Increasing HPV Vaccination Uptake among Adolescents: A Systematic Review..

It also contributes to a reduction in overall immunization coverage. Although there is a growing interest in the use of quality improvement (QI) in complex health systems to improve health outcomes, the degree to which this approach has been used to address MOV is poorly understood. We conducted a scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley's framework to investigate the extent to which QI has been used in health facilities to reduce MOV. The review followed five stages as follows: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying the relevant studies; (3) selecting the studies; (4) charting data; and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results. The search strategy included electronic databases and gray literature. A total of 12 literatures on QI projects focused on addressing MOV were identified. Eleven were published manuscripts, and one was a conference presentation. All the QI projects published were conducted in the United States and majority were between 2014 and 2018. In these projects, 45 change ideas targeting providers, clients, and health system were used. This study generated important evidence on the use of QI in health facilities to reduce MOV. In addition, the result suggests that there is a growing interest in the use of this approach to address MOV in recent years. However, no literature was found in low- and middle-income countries especially sub-Saharan Africa.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adamu AA ; Uthman OA ; Wambiya EO ; Gadanya MA ; Wiysonge CS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Africa South of the Sahara\r\nChild\r\nChild Health\r\n*Delivery of Health Care\r\nHealth Facilities\r\nHumans\r\nQuality Improvement/*statistics & numerical data\r\nVaccination/*statistics & numerical data\r\nMissed opportunities for vaccination\r\nimmunization\r\nimplementation science\r\nquality improvement\r\nquality of care\r\nscoping review\r\nvaccination","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adamu AA, Uthman OA, Wambiya EO, Gadanya MA, and Wiysonge CS (2019) Application of quality improvement approaches in health-care settings to reduce missed opportunities for childhood vaccination: a scoping review..

supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are one of the polio eradication pillars in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) that increased the immunization coverage and made progress towards polio eradication. However, socioecological challenges faced during SIAs contribute to suboptimal campaign quality. The aim of this review is to identify the reported challenges during polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) and associated improvement strategies based on the socioecological model (SEM). METHODS: Articles were searched from three databases which were WOS, Scopus, and PubMed. The systemic review identified the primary articles related to SIA that focused on the impact of immunization coverage, challenges, and improvement strategies. The inclusion criteria were open access English articles that were published between 2012 and 2021 and conducted in the Asia region. RESULTS: There are nine articles described and explained regarding some form of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in their findings across Asia region. The majority of studies selected reported on post vaccination coverage and revealed a multifaceted challenge faced during SIAs which are widely diverse range from the microlevel of interpersonal aspects up to the macrolevel of government policy. Upon further analysis, the intervention at community level was the most dominant strategies reported during the SIA program. CONCLUSIONS: An effective SIAs program provides the opportunity to increase the national capacity of the polio immunization program, reducing inequities in service delivery and offering additional public health benefits in controlling polio outbreaks in both endemic and nonendemic countries. Strengthening routine immunization (RI) programmes is also important for the sustainability of SIA's programs. Despite the challenges and hurdles, many Asian countries exhibited great political willingness to boost polio immunization coverage through SIA efforts.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ahmad H ; Sanef SA ; Shahabudin WZ ; Mohtar N ; Hassan MR ; Jeffree MS ; Lukman KA ; Ghazi HF ; Syed Abdul Rahim SS; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Disease Eradication\r\nVaccination\r\nImmunization\r\nAsia/epidemiology\r\n*Poliomyelitis/epidemiology/prevention & control","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmad H, Sanef SA, Shahabudin WZ, Mohtar N, Hassan MR, Jeffree MS, Lukman KA, Ghazi HF, and Syed Abdul Rahim SS (2023) Socioecological Challenges of Polio Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Systematic Review..

Digital technologies have the potential to help address both suboptimal vaccine uptake and series completion. However, the effectiveness of pushing information and reminders to patients through digital technologies to address vaccination is not known. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study is to determine if digital push interventions are effective in increasing vaccine uptake and series completion compared to non-digital interventions. METHODS: We searched for RCTs where adults or parents of children were eligible for vaccination, the intervention was digital-push and the comparison group was non-digital. We included outcomes of vaccine uptake or series completion. We estimated summary effect sizes, heterogeneity using the χ(2) test and quantified using the I(2) statistic. Where heterogeneity remained significant, we conducted subgroup analyses. We assessed risk of bias, certainty of evidence and publication bias. RESULTS: The search identified 159 peer-reviewed scientific publications. After review, a total of 12 manuscripts representing 13 empirical studies published between 2012 and 2016 were included. When comparing digital push interventions to non-digital ones, patients had 1.18[1.11,1.25] the odds of receiving vaccination or series completion compared to controls. In parents of children aged 18 and younger, those receiving digital push had a 1.22[1.15,1.30] increased odds compared to controls. Both analyses had high statistical heterogeneity, with I(2) values of 86% and 79% respectively. The risk of bias was low with 10 of 13 studies considered low risk in five or more domains. The certainty of evidence for series completion was very low and for vaccine uptake was assessed to be moderate. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that digital push technologies have a modest, positive impact on vaccine uptake and series completion compared to non-digital interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Atkinson KM ; Wilson K ; Murphy MSQ ; El-Halabi S ; Kahale LA ; Laflamme LL ; El-Khatib Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Child\r\n*Computing Methodologies\r\nHealth Education/*methods\r\nHumans\r\nParents/psychology\r\n*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVaccination Coverage/*statistics & numerical data\r\nVaccines/*administration & dosage\r\nHealth Education\r\nImmunization\r\nMobile Applications\r\nTechnology\r\nVaccination Coverage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Atkinson KM, Wilson K, Murphy MSQ, El-Halabi S, Kahale LA, Laflamme LL, and El-Khatib Z (2019) Effectiveness of digital technologies at improving vaccine uptake and series completion - A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials..

With PEHRs being more and more marketed as easily implementable and cost-effective instruments to provide people with direct control on their health, the question on whether their use might be associated with the priority to improve vaccine coverage arises. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines to retrieve, quantitatively pool and critically appraise the effectiveness of PEHR access on vaccine uptake. Analysis on PEHR effectiveness were carried out for the following comparison strata: i) PEHR access vs no intervention (standard care, no access to PEHR), ii) PEHR access only vs access to PEHR with additional features (e.g. health education materials, active reminders). RESULTS: Of 3114 identified citations, 8 studies were included, the majority published in the US and before 2015; 62% were randomized trials, the rest having an observational study design. Evidence suggests a moderate positive impact of PEHR access in increasing vaccine uptake, with data available for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, diabetic patients and childhood immunization. Pooled data report the addition of digital communication features, i.e. the delivery of educational messages, reminders and availability of scheduling features might increase vaccine uptake, as compared to PEHR access alone. However, evidence is not conclusive. CONCLUSION: While immunization programs are struggling to achieve optimal coverage targets, it seems the potential of PEHRSs supporting informed adherence to vaccines recommendations is neither fully exploited nor explored. Which factors mediate the association between PEHRs access and vaccine uptake? Which PEHRs' design and functional components can maximize their impact? On which target populations? Which PEHR models works better for high-risk populations? Our findings can only partially answer those questions and further experimental research is needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Balzarini F ; Frascella B ; Oradini-Alacreu A ; Gaetti G ; Lopalco PL ; Edelstein M ; Azzopardi-Muscat N ; Signorelli C ; Odone A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Child\r\nElectronic Health Records\r\n*Health Records, Personal\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization Programs\r\n*Influenza Vaccines\r\n*Influenza, Human/prevention & control\r\nObservational Studies as Topic\r\nImmunization\r\nPEHR\r\nPersonal electronic health records\r\nSystematic review\r\nVaccines","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Balzarini F, Frascella B, Oradini-Alacreu A, Gaetti G, Lopalco PL, Edelstein M, Azzopardi-Muscat N, Signorelli C, and Odone A (2020) Does the use of personal electronic health records increase vaccine uptake?

STUDY SELECTION: Studies were eligible for the systematic review and meta-analysis if the study compared pharmacist as immunizer versus usual care. Any study design that involved a comparison group was acceptable. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 2 investigators independently with the use of a standardized data extraction form; any differences were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies with 11 study arms met inclusion criteria. A wide variety of immunizations were provided, including influenza, herpes zoster, pneumococcal, Tdap, hepatitis A and B, MMR, varicella, meningococcal, and human papillomavirus. Immunizations were provided in a variety of settings, including hospitals, single community sites, multiple sites, and a university. The overall risk ratio (RR) for immunizations was 2.95 (P <0.001) but varied substantially based on type of vaccine administered (heterogeneity: I(2) = 93.28%). For influenza, the RR was 2.23 (P <0.001), for herpes RR was 4.78 (P <0.001), and for other vaccines RR was 3.44 (P <0.001). The RR for comparisons by type of vaccine and sample size was significant (P = 0.010 and P <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pharmacist immunization programs can have a substantial impact on immunization rates, but the impact varied widely.

Cash transfer programs, microcredit, user fee removal policies and voucher schemes that provide direct or indirect monetary incentives to households have been used for decades in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and more recently in Southeast Asia. Until now, no systematic review of the impact of financial incentives on coverage and uptake of health interventions targeting children under 5 years of age has been conducted. The objective of this review is to provide estimates on the effect of six types of financial incentive programs: (i) Unconditional cash transfers (CT), (ii) Conditional cash transfers (CCT), (iii) Microcredit (MC), (iv) Conditional Microcredit (CMC), (v) Voucher schemes (VS) and (vi) User fee removal (UFR) on the uptake and coverage of health interventions targeting children under the age of five years. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches of a series of databases until September 1st, 2012, to identify relevant studies reporting on the impact of financial incentives on coverage of health interventions and behaviors targeting children under 5 years of age. The quality of the studies was assessed using the CHERG criteria. Meta-analyses were undertaken to estimate the effect when multiple studies meeting our inclusion criteria were available. RESULTS: Our searches resulted in 1671 titles identified 25 studies reporting on the impact of financial incentive programs on 5 groups of coverage indicators: breastfeeding practices (breastfeeding incidence, proportion of children receiving colostrum and early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for six months and duration of breastfeeding); vaccination (coverage of full immunization, partial immunization and specific antigens); health care use (seeking healthcare when child was ill, visits to health facilities for preventive reasons, visits to health facilities for any reason, visits for health check-up including growth control); management of diarrhoeal disease (ORS use during diarrhea episode, continued feeding during diarrhea, healthcare during diarrhea episode) and other preventive health interventions (iron supplementation, vitamin A, zinc supplementation, preventive deworming). The quality of evidence on the effect of financial incentives on breastfeeding practices was low but seems to indicate a potential positive impact on receiving colostrum, early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding and mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding. There is no effect of financial incentives on immunization coverage although there was moderate quality evidence of conditional cash transfers leading to a small but non-significant increase in coverage of age-appropriate immunization. There was low quality evidence of impact of CCT on healthcare use by children under age 5 (Risk difference: 0.14 [95%CI: 0.03; 0.26]) as well as low quality evidence of an effect of user fee removal on use of curative health services (RD=0.62 [0.41; 0.82]). CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives may have potential to promote increased coverage of several important child health interventions, but the quality of evidence available is low. The more pronounced effects seem to be achieved by programs that directly removed user fees for access to health services. Some indication of effect were also observed for programs that conditioned financial incentives on participation in health education and attendance to health care visits. This finding suggest that the measured effect may be less a consequence of the financial incentive and more due to conditionalities addressing important informational barriers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bassani DG ; Arora P ; Wazny K ; Gaffey MF ; Lenters L ; Bhutta ZA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology\r\nAsia, Southeastern/epidemiology\r\nBreast Feeding/economics/*statistics & numerical data\r\nChild\r\nChild Health Services/*economics/*organization & administration\r\nChild Welfare/*economics/statistics & numerical data\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Promotion/*economics/organization & administration\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant Death/prevention & control\r\nLatin America/epidemiology\r\nMale\r\nMalnutrition/prevention & control\r\nQuality Improvement/economics\r\nQuality of Health Care/economics\r\nReimbursement, Incentive/economics/*organization & administration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bassani DG, Arora P, Wazny K, Gaffey MF, Lenters L, and Bhutta ZA (2013) Financial incentives and coverage of child health interventions: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

While flu vaccination coverage (VC) is satisfactory in the elderly, HCWs are less likely to be vaccinated. There is no definitive evidence on which types of healthcare system-based interventions at LTCFs would be more useful in improving the vaccination uptake among HCWs. We performed a systematic review in different databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Health Evidence, Web of Science, Cinahl) to provide a synthesis of the available studies on this topic. Among the 1177 articles screened by their titles and abstracts, 27 were included in this review. Most of the studies reported multiple interventions addressed to improve access to vaccination, eliminate individual barriers, or introduce policy interventions. As expected, mandatory vaccinations seem to be the most useful intervention to increase the vaccination uptake in HCWs. However, our study suggests that better results in the vaccination uptake in HCWs were obtained by combining interventions in different areas. Educational campaigns alone could not have an impact on vaccination coverage. LTCFs represent an ideal setting to perform preventive multi-approach interventions for the epidemiological transition toward aging and chronicity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bechini A ; Lorini C ; Zanobini P ; Mandò Tacconi F; Boccalini S ; Grazzini M ; Bonanni P ; Bonaccorsi G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"healthcare professionals\r\nhealthcare workers (HCWs)\r\ninfluenza vaccination\r\nlong-term care facilities (LTCFs)\r\nnursing homes\r\nstaff\r\nutility\r\nvaccination coverage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bechini A, Lorini C, Zanobini P, Mandò Tacconi F, Boccalini S, Grazzini M, Bonanni P, and Bonaccorsi G (2020) Utility of Healthcare System-Based Interventions in Improving the Uptake of Influenza Vaccination in Healthcare Workers at Long-Term Care Facilities: A Systematic Review..

Providers, payers, and public officials have worked over the years to develop innovative solutions to rapidly and consistently bring new diagnostic tests and therapies to our patients. P4P has been instituted in various forms over the last 30 years. Vaccines are one of society's greatest public health innovations and vaccination programs provide a unique opportunity for P4P programs. We attempted to investigate the effect of P4P compensation model implementation on the vaccination rate. METHODS: Utilizing a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to December 2018. RESULTS: Nine articles were included with poor to moderate quality. Improvements in vaccination rates after implementation of P4P were statistically significant in 8 of 9 of studies. However, due to the heterogeneity of the methods used, we could not pool the data. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review indicate that the implementation of P4P programs can increase the vaccination rate. In recent times when it has become increasingly more popular not to vaccinate, implementing P4P becomes even more important if it is shown to be an effective tool in increasing vaccination rates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Benabbas R ; Shan G ; Akindutire O ; Mehta N ; Sinert R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Reimbursement, Incentive\r\nVaccination Coverage/*economics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Benabbas R, Shan G, Akindutire O, Mehta N, and Sinert R (2019) The Effect of Pay-for-Performance Compensation Model Implementation on Vaccination Rate: A Systematic Review..

One of the main determinants of non-adherence to influenza vaccination among healthcare workers (HCWs) is lack of time to attend vaccination services. Therefore, international Public Health Organizations have recommended on-site influenza vaccination in order to improve vaccination coverage among HCWs. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a systematic narrative review of the relevant literature to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy among HCWs in Italy. Fifteen studies, selected among scientific articles available in MEDLINE/PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus and published from January 1(st), 2018, to May 31(st), 2022, were included. A significant relationship was evidenced between influenza vaccine uptake and adoption of an on-site outpatient clinic (OR = 2.06; 95%CI = 1.43-2.95). The review highlighted a significant increase in VC when on-site vaccination was implemented (even exceeding +150% compared to the previous season), among other measures. Nevertheless, none of the reported experiences proved to meet the minimum target of 75% VC among HCWs. EXPERT OPINION: Despite strategies to achieve greater willingness to immunize in this category, mandatory vaccination appears to be the only one that can guarantee protection for HCWs and the patients they care for.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bianchi FP ; Stefanizzi P ; Cuscianna E ; Di Lorenzo A ; Martinelli A ; Tafuri S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Influenza, Human/prevention & control\r\nAttitude of Health Personnel\r\nVaccination\r\n*Influenza Vaccines\r\nHealth Personnel\r\nItaly\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nHealthcare workers\r\ninfluenza\r\nmandatory vaccination\r\nnosocomial infection\r\nvaccine compliance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bianchi FP, Stefanizzi P, Cuscianna E, Di Lorenzo A, Martinelli A, and Tafuri S (2023) Effectiveness of on-site influenza vaccination strategy in Italian healthcare workers: a systematic review and statistical analysis..

Equity remains a priority in the international health development agenda. However, major inequities in vaccination coverage jeopardise the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We aim at comprehensively describing how research has addressed equity issues related to vaccination. METHODS: We carried out an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) that explicitly explored the effects of interventions to improve vaccination in any context; for any vaccine and, in any language. We followed standard research synthesis methods to systematically search for SR, assess them for inclusion and extracting relevant data, particularly on vaccination related outcomes. To gather evidence on equity issues addressed in the SR, we used the PROGRESS-plus framework. FINDINGS: Our search obtained 2,003 hits which resulted in 54 included SRs, published between 1994 and 2014. The quality of SRs was generally poor, with less than half complying with most of the quality criteria. Reported vaccines included, by order of frequency, influenza and Expanded Programme on Immunisation vaccines. The types of interventions more frequently reported were related to vaccination delivery strategies, financial support and information, education and communication. Most of the SRs suggested effects favouring intervention groups as opposed to comparison groups. The most frequently reported equity attribute was 'place of residence' and the least reported equity attributes were sexual orientation and religion. Very few estimates of effects actually measured differences or changes between groups having those attributes and all of them referred to the place of residence. No data was found about reducing equity gaps for vulnerable groups or minorities, or attributes such as sexual orientation, education or specific religious groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although research on vulnerable populations as a subgroup is abundant, it fails to report on the interventions that will actually reduce inequities and consider how redistribution of health care resources could shrink the gap between the privileged and most vulnerable groups including minorities. Research, if aiming at being responsive to global health policy trends, needs to report not only on specific attributes but also on how a better redistribution of health care resources could contribute to alleviating the unjust situation of the most vulnerable populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bosch-Capblanch X ; Zuske MK ; Auer C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Biomedical Research/*methods\r\n*Global Health\r\n*Health Equity\r\nHumans\r\n*Population Groups\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVaccination/*statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bosch-Capblanch X, Zuske MK, and Auer C (2017) Research on subgroups is not research on equity attributes: Evidence from an overview of systematic reviews on vaccination..

In rural communities, HPV vaccination coverage is low, yet incidence and mortality rates of HPV-associated cancer are high. Much of the research focused on HPV vaccination in rural U.S. communities has involved qualitative investigations, observations, survey research, and secondary data analysis with limited implementation of interventional study designs. The purpose of this narrative review was to examine intervention studies to increase HPV vaccination in rural settings and to summarize study characteristics and associated outcomes. PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched utilizing systematic narrative review methodology for studies describing implementation of HPV vaccination interventions in rural U.S. settings from January 2006-December 2019. Using specific search criteria, 991 studies were identified. After abstract review, 30 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 15 met the inclusion criteria. The 15 articles - published from 2011 to 2019 - described HPV vaccination interventions in rural settings of six states, including communities, health clinics, and schools. A range of primary and secondary outcomes were reported, including HPV vaccine receipt (series initiation, continuation, and/or completion); HPV vaccine knowledge; and/or cervical cancer knowledge. Across the studies, there was an absence of the description of rural context. As compared to the broader HPV vaccination intervention literature, interventions in rural settings were limited. More interventional research is needed in rural communities given the elevated rates of HPV-related cancer and low rates of HPV vaccine uptake.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brandt HM ; Vanderpool RC ; Pilar M ; Zubizarreta M ; Stradtman LR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control\r\n*Papillomavirus Vaccines\r\nRural Population\r\nUnited States\r\n*Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/prevention & control\r\nVaccination\r\nNeoplasms\r\nPapillomavirus vaccines\r\nRural populations\r\nUnited States\r\nVaccination","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brandt HM, Vanderpool RC, Pilar M, Zubizarreta M, and Stradtman LR (2021) A narrative review of HPV vaccination interventions in rural U.S. communities..

We searched 5 electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane, LILACS) for studies published prior to June 2016 and identified 47 relevant articles. We found that pharmacy-based immunization services (PBIS) have been facilitated by state regulatory changes and training programs that allow pharmacists to directly provide vaccinations. These services are widely accepted by both patients and pharmacy staff, and are capable of improving access and increasing vaccination rates.

This urbanizing trend has been accompanied by an increasing number of people living in urban poor communities and slums. Lower immunization coverage is found in poorer urban dwellers in many contexts. This study aims to identify factors associated with immunization coverage in poor urban areas and slums, and to identify interventions to improve coverage. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, searching Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Web of Science and The Cochrane Database with broad search terms for studies published between 2000 and 2016. RESULTS: Of 4872 unique articles, 327 abstracts were screened, leading to 63 included studies: 44 considering factors and 20 evaluating interventions (one in both categories) in 16 low or middle-income countries. A wide range of socio-economic characteristics were associated with coverage in different contexts. Recent rural-urban migration had a universally negative effect. Parents commonly reported lack of awareness of immunization importance and difficulty accessing services as reasons for under-immunization of their children. Physical distance to clinics and aspects of service quality also impacted uptake. We found evidence of effectiveness for interventions involving multiple components, especially if they have been designed with community involvement. Outreach programmes were effective where physical distance was identified as a barrier. Some evidence was found for the effective use of SMS (text) messaging services, community-based education programmes and financial incentives, which warrant further evaluation. No interventions were identified that provided services to migrants from rural areas. CONCLUSION: Different factors affect immunization coverage in different urban poor and slum contexts. Immunization services should be designed in collaboration with slum-dwelling communities, considering the local context. Interventions should be designed and tested to increase immunization in migrants from rural areas.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Crocker-Buque T ; Mindra G ; Duncan R ; Mounier-Jack S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data\r\nFemale\r\n*Health Education\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization/*statistics & numerical data\r\nMale\r\n*Poverty Areas\r\nUrban Population/*statistics & numerical data\r\n*Urbanization\r\nVaccination/*statistics & numerical data\r\nImmunization\r\nLow-income\r\nSlum\r\nUrban\r\nVaccine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Crocker-Buque T, Mindra G, Duncan R, and Mounier-Jack S (2017) Immunization, urbanization and slums - a systematic review of factors and interventions..

Until recently, most of the existing immunization programs targeted infants and children younger than 5 years which have successfully resulted in reducing global infant and child mortality. Adolescent immunization has been relatively neglected, leaving a quarter of world's population underimmunized and hence vulnerable to a number of preventable diseases. In recent years, a large number of programs have been launched to increase the uptake of different vaccines in adolescents; however, the recommended vaccination coverage among the adolescent population overall remains very low, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Adolescent vaccination has received significantly more attention since the advent of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2006. However, only half of the adolescent girls in the United States received a single dose of HPV vaccine while merely 43% and 33% received two and three doses, respectively. We systematically reviewed literature published up to December 2014 and included 23 studies on the effectiveness of interventions to improve immunization coverage among adolescents. Moderate-quality evidence suggested an overall increase in vaccination coverage by 78% (relative risk: 1.78; 95% confidence interval: 1.41-2.23). Review findings suggest that interventions including implementing vaccination requirement in school, sending reminders, and national permissive recommendation for adolescent vaccination have the potential to improve immunization uptake. Strategies to improve coverage for HPV vaccines resulted in a significant decrease in the prevalence of HPV by 44% and genital warts by 33%; however, the quality of evidence was low. Analysis from single studies with low- or very low-quality evidence suggested significant decrease in varicella deaths, measles incidence, rubella susceptibility, and incidence of pertussis while the impact was nonsignificant for incidence of mumps with their respective vaccines. Further rigorous evidence is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to improve immunization uptake among adolescents from low- and middle-income countries.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Das JK ; Salam RA ; Arshad A ; Lassi ZS ; Bhutta ZA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent health\r\nImmunization\r\nNational permissive recommendation\r\nNational vaccination\r\nReminders\r\nSchool vaccination\r\nVaccination","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Das JK, Salam RA, Arshad A, Lassi ZS, and Bhutta ZA (2016) Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Interventions to Improve Access and Coverage of Adolescent Immunizations..

Vaccination is a critical step in reducing child mortality; however, vaccination rates have declined in many countries in recent years. This decrease has been associated with an increase in the outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases. The potential for leveraging mobile platforms to promote vaccination coverage has been investigated in the development of numerous mobile apps. Although many are available for public use, there is little robust evaluation of these apps. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of apps supporting childhood vaccinations in improving vaccination uptake, knowledge, and decision making as well as the usability and user perceptions of these apps. METHODS: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) databases were systematically searched for studies published between 2008 and 2019 that evaluated childhood vaccination apps. Two authors screened and selected studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted and analyzed, and the studies were assessed for risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies evaluating 25 apps met the inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. Overall, 9 studies assessed vaccination uptake, of which 4 reported significant benefits (P<.001 or P=.03) of the implementation of the app. Similarly, 4 studies indicated a significant (P≤.054) impact on knowledge and on vaccination decision making. Patient perceptions, usability, and acceptability were generally positive. The quality of the included studies was found to be moderate to poor, with many aspects of the methodology being unclear. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence to support the use of childhood vaccination apps to improve vaccination uptake, knowledge, or decision making. Further research is required to understand the dichotomous effects of vaccination-related information provision and the evaluation of these apps in larger, more robust studies. The methodology of studies must be reported more comprehensively to accurately assess the effectiveness of childhood vaccination apps and the risk of bias of studies.

However, there is limited evidence on the acceptability of mobile-phone reminders among patients and caregivers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the ownership of mobile-phone device and the willingness to receive mobile-phone reminders among mothers/caregivers utilizing routine childhood immunization services in Nigeria. METHOD: MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, CNKI, AJOL (African Journal Online), and Web of Science were systematically searched for studies on the acceptability of mobile-phone reminders for routine immunization appointments among mothers/caregivers in Nigeria. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and JBI critical appraisal checklists. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model to generate pooled estimates (proportion) of mothers who owned at least one mobile phone and proportion of mothers willing to receive mobile-phone reminders. RESULTS: Sixteen studies (13 cross-sectional and three interventional) involving a total of 9923 mothers across 15 states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja met inclusion criteria. Pooled estimates showed that the proportion of mothers who owned at least one mobile phone was 96.4% (95% CI = 94.1-98.2%; I(2) = 96.3%) while the proportion of mothers willing to receive mobile-phone reminders was 86.0% (95% CI = 79.8-91.3%, I(2) = 98.4%). Most mothers preferred to receive text message reminders at least 24 h before the routine immunization appointment day, and in the morning hours. Approximately 52.8% of the mothers preferred to receive reminders in English, the country's official language. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests a high acceptability for mobile-phone reminder interventions to improve routine childhood immunization coverage and timeliness. Further studies, however, are needed to better understand unique regional preferences and assess the operational costs, long-term effects, and risks of this intervention.

Twelve relevant studies were identified with a total of 38,945 participants. RESULTS: The interventions were delivered using several different methods, including electronic health record (i.e. recall/reminder) prompts, text messaging, automated phone calls, interactive computer videos, and email. Vaccine initiation and completion was greater for technology-based studies relative to their control conditions. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that interventions utilizing communication technologies as their sole or primary mode for HPV vaccination intervention delivery may increase vaccination coverage.

Scant evidence exists on the impact of email-based immunization reminders. In particular, while email communication is exponentially increasing at the global level, its use for health communication is still sporadic and limited data exists on its application to immunization programmes. The objective of this study is to systematically retrieve and critically appraise the available literature on the effectiveness of email-based reminders to increase vaccine uptake, with the ultimate aim to inform and encourage its integration in the implementation of immunization programmes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature following the PRISMA. We included studies providing quantitative comparative data on any measure of vaccine uptake. We extracted data on study design, study population, vaccine type and details of email-based interventions; data were pooled by type of comparison (no reminders, traditional reminders, other digital reminders). RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, 90% with experimental study designs. While email communication succeeds in increasing vaccine uptake when compared with no intervention, weak and heterogeneous data exist supporting the superiority of email reminders, as compared to traditional methods or other digital reminders. Encouraging evidence report the effectiveness of reminder methods combining different strategies and tailored to target populations' preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, email communication offers many advantages: it is cheaper and faster, it can be automated and linked to electronic immunization registries, and reach people on the move. As we urge the need for further research to prove email communication impact on vaccine uptake in different settings, we underline the importance of identifying how to best integrate email communication in vaccine delivery equipping immunization programmes with technical infrastructures and normative frameworks suitable to embrace innovation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Frascella B ; Oradini-Alacreu A ; Balzarini F ; Signorelli C ; Lopalco PL ; Odone A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Electronic Mail/*trends\r\nHealth Communication/methods/*trends\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization/methods/psychology/trends\r\nImmunization Programs/methods/trends\r\nReminder Systems/*trends\r\nVaccination/methods/psychology/*trends\r\nVaccines/*administration & dosage\r\nDigital health\r\nEmail\r\nImmunisation\r\nSystematic review\r\nVaccination reminders\r\nVaccination uptake","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Frascella B, Oradini-Alacreu A, Balzarini F, Signorelli C, Lopalco PL, and Odone A (2020) Effectiveness of email-based reminders to increase vaccine uptake: a systematic review..

Immunization information systems (IISs) are confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all vaccination doses administered by participating providers to people residing within a given geopolitical area. They facilitate consolidation of vaccination histories for use by health care providers in determining appropriate client vaccinations. Immunization information systems also provide aggregate data on immunizations for use in monitoring coverage and program operations and to guide public health action. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Methods for conducting systematic reviews for the Guide to Community Preventive Services were used to assess the effectiveness of IISs. Reviewed evidence examined changes in vaccination rates in client populations or described expanded IIS capabilities related to improving vaccinations. The literature search identified 108 published articles and 132 conference abstracts describing or evaluating the use of IISs in different assessment categories. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Studies described or evaluated IIS capabilities to (1) create or support effective interventions to increase vaccination rates, such as client reminder and recall, provider assessment and feedback, and provider reminders; (2) determine client vaccination status to inform decisions by clinicians, health care systems, and schools; (3) guide public health responses to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease; (4) inform assessments of vaccination coverage, missed vaccination opportunities, invalid dose administration, and disparities; and (5) facilitate vaccine management and accountability. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from 240 articles and abstracts demonstrate IIS capabilities and actions in increasing vaccination rates with the goal of reducing vaccine-preventable disease.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Groom H ; Hopkins DP ; Pabst LJ ; Murphy Morgan J; Patel M ; Calonge N ; Coyle R ; Dombkowski K ; Groom AV ; Kurilo MB ; Rasulnia B ; Shefer A ; Town C ; Wortley PM ; Zucker J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\nImmunization Programs/*methods\r\n*Information Systems\r\nMass Vaccination/*methods/statistics & numerical data\r\nPublic Health/methods/standards\r\nVaccines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Groom H, Hopkins DP, Pabst LJ, Murphy Morgan J, Patel M, Calonge N, Coyle R, Dombkowski K, Groom AV, Kurilo MB, Rasulnia B, Shefer A, Town C, Wortley PM, and Zucker J (2015) Immunization information systems to increase vaccination rates: a community guide systematic review..

Vaccinations are recognized as the best primary prevention strategy to counteract infectious diseases. However, in recent years, there has been a decrease in the immunization rate, particularly among children and teenagers. Several strategies have been tested to circumvent the issue. Among them, there was the re-introduction of vaccination practices in schools. The literature shows that introducing immunization projects in schools has increased vaccination rates in children and teenagers, but the role of the school nurse in these settings has never been evaluated. AIM: To determine whether the role of the school nurse, within the school vaccination projects, does have a positive impact on the rate of immunization's compliance. METHODS: Narrative review. Studies of primary, secondary and gray literature were included, researched on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index and Web of Science. Nine articles based on studies conducted in different educational institutions (from kindergarten to high school) were included in the review. RESULTS: All the articles included in the review showed that the interventions conducted by the school nurse, aimed at increasing the rate of adhesion to vaccinations, are effective. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The literature related to the topic of the present study shows that the school nurse plays a key role in increasing the rate of adhesion to immunization for school-age children / adolescents. The figure of the school nurse plays a crucial role in increasing the rate of adhesion to immunization's programme for school-age children. However, in several countries, including Italy, this figure was present in the past but does not exist now.

This systematic review critically evaluated peer-review and grey literature evidence on the effectiveness of system-level interventions for improving vaccination coverage in protracted crises, focusing on how they work, and for whom, to better inform preparedness and response for future crises. METHODS: Realist-informed systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature. Keyword-structured searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health, CINAHL, the Cochrane Collaboration and WHOLIS, and grey literature searches performed through the websites of UNICEF, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and Technical Network for Strengthening Immunization Services. Results were independently double-screened for inclusion on title and abstract, and full text. Data were extracted using a pre-developed template, capturing information on the operating contexts in which interventions were implemented, intervention mechanisms, and vaccination-related outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the MMAT tool. Findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 50 studies were included, most describing interventions applied in conflict or near-post conflict settings in sub-Saharan Africa, and complex humanitarian emergencies. Vaccination campaigns were the most commonly addressed adaptive mechanism (n = 17). Almost all campaigns operated using multi-modal approaches combining service delivery through multiple pathways (fixed and roving), health worker recruitment and training and community engagement to address both vaccination supply and demand. Creation of collaterals through service integration showed generally positive evidence of impact on routine vaccination uptake by bringing services closer to target populations and leveraging trust that had already been built with communities. Robust community engagement emerged as a key unifying mechanism for outcome improvement across almost all of the intervention classes, in building awareness and trust among crisis-affected populations. Some potentially transformative mechanisms for strengthening resilience in vaccination delivery were identified, but evidence for these remains limited. CONCLUSION: A number of interventions to support adaptations to routine immunisation delivery in the face of protracted crisis are identifiable, as are key unifying mechanisms (multi-level community engagement) apparently irrespective of context, but evidence remains piecemeal. Adapting these approaches for local system resilience-building remains a key challenge.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ismail SA ; Lam ST ; Bell S ; Fouad FM ; Blanchet K ; Borghi J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Vaccination\r\n*Immunization Programs\r\nVaccination Coverage\r\nImmunization\r\nDelivery of Health Care\r\nHealth system\r\nHumanitarian crisis\r\nProtracted crisis\r\nRefugee\r\nVaccination\r\nVaccine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ismail SA, Lam ST, Bell S, Fouad FM, Blanchet K, and Borghi J (2022) Strengthening vaccination delivery system resilience in the context of protracted humanitarian crisis: a realist-informed systematic review..

As a result, vaccine‐preventable diseases still occur. In an era of increasing complexity of immunization schedules, rising expectations about the performance of primary care, and large demands on primary care providers, it is important to understand and promote interventions that work in primary care settings to increase immunization coverage. One common theme across immunization programs in many nations involves the challenge of implementing a population‐based approach and identifying all eligible recipients, for example the children who should receive the measles vaccine. However, this issue is gradually being addressed through the availability of immunization registries and electronic health records. A second common theme is identifying the best strategies to promote high vaccination rates. Three types of strategies have been studied: (1) patient‐oriented interventions, such as patient reminder or recall, (2) provider interventions, and (3) system interventions, such as school laws. One of the most prominent intervention strategies, and perhaps best studied, involves patient reminder or recall systems. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various types of patient reminder and recall interventions to improve receipt of immunizations. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to January 2017. We also searched grey literature and trial registers to January 2017. Selection criteria We included randomized trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series evaluating immunization‐focused patient reminder or recall interventions in children, adolescents, and adults who receive immunizations in any setting. We included no‐intervention control groups, standard practice activities that did not include immunization patient reminder or recall, media‐based activities aimed at promoting immunizations, or simple practice‐based awareness campaigns. We included receipt of any immunizations as eligible outcome measures, excluding special travel immunizations. We excluded patients who were hospitalized for the duration of the study period. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We present results for individual studies as relative rates using risk ratios, and risk differences for randomized trials, and as absolute changes in percentage points for controlled before‐after studies. We present pooled results for randomized trials using the random‐effects model. Main results The 75 included studies involved child, adolescent, and adult participants in outpatient, community‐based, primary care, and other settings in 10 countries. Patient reminder or recall interventions, including telephone and autodialer calls, letters, postcards, text messages, combination of mail or telephone, or a combination of patient reminder or recall with outreach, probably improve the proportion of participants who receive immunization (risk ratio (RR) of 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 1.35; risk difference of 8%) based on moderate certainty evidence from 55 studies with 138,625 participants. Three types of single‐method reminders improve receipt of immunizations based on high certainty evidence: the use of postcards (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30; eight studies; 27,734 participants), text messages (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.44; six studies; 7772 participants), and autodialer (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32; five studies; 11,947 participants). Two types of single‐method reminders probably improve receipt of immunizations based on moderate certainty evidence: the use of telephone calls (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.54; seven studies; 9120 participants) and letters to patients (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.38; 27 studies; 81,100 participants). Based on high certainty evidence, reminders improve receipt of immunizations for childhood (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.29; risk difference of 8%; 23 studies; 31,099 participants) and adolescent vaccinations (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.42; r isk difference of 7%; 10 studies; 30,868 participants). Reminders probably improve receipt of vaccinations for childhood influenza (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.99; risk difference of 22%; five studies; 9265 participants) and adult influenza (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.43; risk difference of 9%; 15 studies; 59,328 participants) based on moderate certainty evidence. They may improve receipt of vaccinations for adult pneumococcus, tetanus, hepatitis B, and other non‐influenza vaccinations based on low certainty evidence although the confidence interval includes no effect of these interventions (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.78; four studies; 8065 participants). Authors' conclusions Patient reminder and recall systems, in primary care settings, are likely to be effective at improving the proportion of the target population who receive immunizations. Plain language summary Do strategies to remind people to have vaccinations increase the number of people who receive vaccinations? Aim of this review The aim of this review is to determine whether strategies to remind people to receive vaccinations increase the number of people who receive vaccinations. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Key messages Reminding people to receive their vaccinations increases vaccination rates across different populations. What was studied Vaccinations are used to prevent a number of diseases but there is wide variation in vaccination coverage across different regions and countries. This can lead to diseases that are otherwise preventable by vaccines, having a large effect on individuals and communities. Informing people of an upcoming vaccination or telling them that they have missed a vaccination might help to increase coverage and reduce the effect and impact of disease preventable by vaccine. We reviewed 75 studies to evaluate whether reminding people to get vaccinated worked. The studies we looked at were from different settings, such as rural areas, schools, private practices, and state health departments. Most studies were done in the USA. The studies included a range of different groups: infants and children, adolescents and adults requiring routine vaccination, as well as adults who required the influenza vaccine. In most of the studies reminders took the form of person to person telephone calls, automated calls, letters or postcards. In few recent studies text messaging was used. Main results of the review Our review found that reminding people to have vaccinations likely increases the number of people who receive vaccinations by an average of 8 percentage points, although there was variation in the results of the studies. Reminding people by telephone and autodialer calls, sending a letter or postcard, or sending a text message increased vaccinations. Combinations of reminders were also effective. Reminding people over the telephone was more effective than the other types of reminders. The increases in vaccinations were observed among children, adolescents, and adults. How up‐to‐date is this review? We reviewed studies that were published to January 2017.","Comments":"[Effective Practice and Organisation of Care]","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jacobson Vann ; JC  ; Jacobson RM ; Coyne‐Beasley T ; Asafu‐Adjei JK ; Szilagyi PG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Reminder Systems [statistics & numerical data]\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nChild\r\nCorrespondence as Topic\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization Programs [organization & administration]\r\nImmunization [*statistics & numerical data]\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTelephone [statistics & numerical data]\r\nText Messaging [statistics & numerical data]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jacobson Vann, JC , Jacobson RM, Coyne‐Beasley T, Asafu‐Adjei JK, and Szilagyi PG (2018) Patient reminder and recall interventions to improve immunization rates.

Nonetheless, rates of routine vaccination of children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are strikingly low or stagnant. In 2019, an estimated 19.7 million infants did not receive routine immunisations. Community engagement interventions are increasingly being emphasised in international and national policy frameworks as a means to improve immunisation coverage and reach marginalised communities. This systematic review examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of community engagement interventions on outcomes related to childhood immunisation in LMICs and identifies contextual, design and implementation features that may be associated with effectiveness. We identified 61 quantitative and mixed methods impact evaluations and 47 associated qualitative studies related to community engagement interventions for inclusion in the reteview. For cost-effectiveness analysis 14 of the 61 studies had the needed combination of cost and effectiveness data. The 61 included impact evaluations were concentrated in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and spread across 19 LMICs. The review found that community engagement interventions had a small but significant, positive effect on all primary immunisation outcomes related to coverage and their timeliness. The findings are robust to exclusion of studies assessed as high risk of bias. Qualitative evidence indicates appropriate intervention design, including building in community engagement features; addressing common contextual barriers of immunisation and leveraging facilitators; and accounting for existing implementation constraints and practicalities on the ground are consistently cited as reasons for intervention success. Among the studies for which we were able to calculate cost-effectiveness, we find that the median non-vaccine cost per dose of intervention to increase immunisation coverage by 1% was US $3.68. Given the broad scope of the review in terms of interventions and outcomes, there is significant variation in findings. Among the various types of community engagement interventions, those that involve creation of community buy-in or development of new cadres of community-based structures were found to have consistent positive effect on more primary vaccination coverage outcomes than if the engagement is limited to the design or delivery of an intervention or is a combination of the various types. The evidence base for sub-group analysis for female children was sparse (only two studies) and the effect on coverage of both full immunisation and third dose of diphtheria pertussis tetanus for this group was insignificant.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jain M ; Shisler S ; Lane C ; Bagai A ; Brown E ; Engelbert M ; Vardy Y ; Eyers J ; Leon DA ; Parsekar SS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jain M, Shisler S, Lane C, Bagai A, Brown E, Engelbert M, Vardy Y, Eyers J, Leon DA, and Parsekar SS (2022) Use of community engagement interventions to improve child immunisation in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis..

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, POPLINE, ECONLIT, CINAHL, LILACS, BDSP, Web of Science and Scopus databases for relevant studies, published in English, French, German, Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish up to 25 March 2014. We included studies of interventions intended to increase demand for routine childhood vaccination. Studies were eligible if conducted in low- and middle-income countries and employing a randomized controlled trial, non-randomized controlled trial, controlled before-and-after or interrupted time series design. We estimated risk of bias using Cochrane collaboration guidelines and performed random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: We identified 11 studies comprising four randomized controlled trials, six cluster randomized controlled trials and one controlled before-and-after study published in English between 1996 and 2013. Participants were generally parents of young children exposed to an eligible intervention. Six studies demonstrated low risk of bias and five studies had moderate to high risk of bias. We conducted a pooled analysis considering all 11 studies, with data from 11,512 participants. Demand-side interventions were associated with significantly higher receipt of vaccines, relative risk (RR): 1.30, (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.17-1.44). Subgroup analyses also demonstrated significant effects of seven education and knowledge translation studies, RR: 1.40 (95% CI: 1.20-1.63) and of four studies which used incentives, RR: 1.28 (95% CI: 1.12-1.45). CONCLUSION: Demand-side interventions lead to significant gains in child vaccination coverage in low- and middle-income countries. Educational approaches and use of incentives were both effective strategies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Johri M ; Pérez MC ; Arsenault C ; Sharma JK ; Pai NP ; Pahwa S ; Sylvestre MP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bias\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nCommunicable Disease Control/methods\r\nDeveloping Countries\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Promotion/*methods/statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization/*statistics & numerical data\r\nInfant\r\nMale\r\nPoverty\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVaccination/*statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Johri M, Pérez MC, Arsenault C, Sharma JK, Pai NP, Pahwa S, and Sylvestre MP (2015) Strategies to increase the demand for childhood vaccination in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

To achieve and maintain appropriate coverage rates, vaccination programmes rely on people having sufficient awareness and acceptance of vaccines. Face‐to‐face information or educational interventions are widely used to help parents understand why vaccines are important; explain where, how and when to access services; and address hesitancy and concerns about vaccine safety or efficacy. Such interventions are interactive, and can be adapted to target particular populations or identified barriers. This is an update of a review originally published in 2013. Objectives To assess the effects of face‐to‐face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination on vaccination status and parental knowledge, attitudes and intention to vaccinate. Search methods We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and two trial registries (July and August 2017). We screened reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. We had no language or date restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs evaluating the effects of face‐to‐face interventions delivered to parents or expectant parents to inform or educate them about early childhood vaccination, compared with control or with another face‐to‐face intervention. The World Health Organization recommends that children receive all early childhood vaccines, with the exception of human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), which is delivered to adolescents. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently reviewed all search results, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Main results In this update, we found four new studies, for a total of ten studies. We included seven RCTs and three cluster‐RCTs involving a total of 4527 participants, although we were unable to pool the data from one cluster‐RCT. Three of the ten studies were conducted in low‐ or middle‐ income countries. All included studies compared face‐to‐face interventions with control. Most studies evaluated the effectiveness of a single intervention session delivered to individual parents. The interventions were an even mix of short (ten minutes or less) and longer sessions (15 minutes to several hours). Overall, elements of the study designs put them at moderate to high risk of bias. All studies but one were at low risk of bias for sequence generation (i.e. used a random number sequence). For allocation concealment (i.e. the person randomising participants was unaware of the study group to which participant would be allocated), three were at high risk and one was judged at unclear risk of bias. Due to the educational nature of the intervention, blinding of participants and personnel was not possible in any studies. The risk of bias due to blinding of outcome assessors was judged as low for four studies. Most studies were at unclear risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Other potential sources of bias included failure to account for clustering in a cluster‐RCT and significant unexplained baseline differences between groups. One cluster‐RCT was at high risk for selective recruitment of participants. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low for the outcomes of children's vaccination status, parents' attitudes or beliefs, intention to vaccinate, adverse effects (e.g. anxiety), and immunisation cost, and moderate for parents' knowledge or understanding. All studies had limitations in design. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence where we judged that studies had problems with randomisation or allocation concealment, or when outcomes were self‐reported by participants who knew whether they'd received the intervention or not. We also downgraded the certainty for inconsistency (vaccination status), imprecision (intention to vaccinate and adverse effects), and indirectness (attitudes or beliefs, and cost). Low‐certainty evidence from seven studies (3004 participants) suggested that face‐to‐face interventions to inform or educate parents may improve vaccination status (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.37). Moderate‐certainty evidence from four studies (657 participants) found that face‐to‐face interventions probably slightly improved parent knowledge (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.19, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.38), and low‐certainty evidence from two studies (179 participants) suggested they may slightly improve intention to vaccinate (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.85). Low‐certainty evidence found the interventions may lead to little or no change in parent attitudes or beliefs about vaccination (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.20 to 0.27; three studies, 292 participants), or in parents’ anxiety (mean difference (MD) ‐1.93, 95% CI ‐7.27 to 3.41; one study, 90 participants). Only one study (365 participants) measured the intervention cost of a case management strategy, reporting that the estimated additional cost per fully immunised child for the intervention was approximately eight times higher than usual care (low‐certainty evidence). No included studies reported outcomes associated with parents’ experience of the intervention (e.g. satisfaction). Authors' conclusions There is low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence suggesting that face‐to‐face information or education may improve or slightly improve children's vaccination status, parents' knowledge, and parents' intention to vaccinate. Face‐to‐face interventions may be more effective in populations where lack of awareness or understanding of vaccination is identified as a barrier (e.g. where people are unaware of new or optional vaccines). The effect of the intervention in a population where concerns about vaccines or vaccine hesitancy is the primary barrier is less clear. Reliable and validated scales for measuring more complex outcomes, such as attitudes or beliefs, are necessary in order to improve comparisons of the effects across studies. Plain language summary Face‐to‐face interventions to inform or educate parents about early childhood vaccination Review question The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether face‐to‐face information or education delivered to parents or expectant parents improved vaccination status, parental knowledge or understanding of vaccination, attitudes or beliefs about vaccination, or intention to vaccinate. We also looked for evidence about any negative impacts of the intervention, such as anxiety, and evidence about cost and parents’ experiences of the intervention. This is an update of a review originally published in 2013. In this update, we found four new studies, for a total of ten studies. Background Childhood vaccination is an important and effective way to reduce childhood illness and death. However, many children do not receive the recommended vaccines, because their parents or caregivers do not know why vaccination is important, do not understand how, where, or when to get their children vaccinated, or have concerns or doubts about vaccine safety and efficacy. One way to inform or educate parents about vaccination is through face‐to‐face discussions, either one‐on‐one, or in groups. This strategy can be used and adapted in any setting. Study characteristics We included trials published up to July 2017. We found ten studies with a total of 4527 participants that looked at the effects of face‐to‐face information or education for parents. Seven studies were from high‐income countries, and three were from low‐ or middle‐income countries. The interventions were a mix of short (under ten minutes) and longer sessions (15 minutes to several hours) that were delivered to new or expectant parents. Key results We analysed data on the effects of face‐to‐face information or education on seven different outcomes. According to the included studies, face‐to‐face information or education may have improved children’s vaccination status, probably slightly improved parents’ knowledge or understanding of vaccination, and may slightly have improved parents’ intention to vaccinate. These interventions may have led to little or no difference in parental attitudes or anxiety related to the intervention. Only one study measured the cost of a face‐to‐face case management strategy. In this study, the cost of fully immunising one additional child was eight times the cost of usual care, but the intervention was complex, and the study was older, and not widely generalisable. No studies measured parents’ satisfaction with the face‐to‐face intervention. Certainty of the evidence We judged the certainty of the evidence to be moderate for parents' knowledge or understanding, but low for all other outcomes. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence where studies were judged to have problems with bias from different sources (e.g. the way in which participants were assigned to study groups), where there was a lot of variability in results or imprecise estimates, or where we had misgivings about the choice of outcomes measures. Conclusions This review suggests that immunisation‐focused educational messages may be sufficient to improve vaccination coverage and, to a small degree, knowledge, particularly where awareness is identified as a barrier to vaccination.","Comments":"[Consumers and Communication]","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kaufman J ; Ryan R ; Walsh L ; Horey D ; Leask J ; Robinson P ; Hill S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Vaccination\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nHealth Education [*methods]\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nMothers [education]\r\nParents [*education]\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kaufman J, Ryan R, Walsh L, Horey D, Leask J, Robinson P, and Hill S (2018) Face‐to‐face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination.

METHODS: A search was conducted using MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science databases for hospital-based, inpatient studies which evaluated strategies to improve pneumococcal vaccination rates. Studies published in English from 1983 to 2013 were included. Data abstracted was analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies were included; 15 evaluated physician reminders (e.g. chart or paper reminders, pre-printed orders (PPOs), computerized reminders, checklists) and 21 standing orders programs (SOPs). The most common study design was pre/post, and only 7 studies had a control group. Overall, 32 studies showed improvements in the rate of pneumococcal vaccination following intervention (19 statistically significant), with reminders showing 29-74% immunization rate, PPCO 5-42%, and SOPs 3.4-78%. CONCLUSION: Hospital-based interventions improve pneumococcal vaccination in older adults and younger individuals at risk. Although this review found that more success was observed with SOPs the impact on immunization rates in eligible patients varied significantly. Thus, high quality, randomized-controlled studies are required to determine the effect of each type of institutional immunization strategy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kim S ; Hughes CA ; Sadowski CA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Hospital Administration\r\nHospitalization\r\nHumans\r\n*Immunization Programs\r\nPneumococcal Infections/*prevention & control\r\n*Pneumococcal Vaccines\r\nVaccination\r\nAged\r\nGeriatric\r\nHospital\r\nInfection\r\nInpatient\r\nPneumococcal\r\nVaccination","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kim S, Hughes CA, and Sadowski CA (2014) A review of acute care interventions to improve inpatient pneumococcal vaccination..

The interventions were summarized into three pillars according to the European Union Conceptional Framework for Action: information campaigns, prioritization of vaccination schemes, and primary care interventions. RESULTS: Our scoping review included 39 studies that summarized interventions related to pneumococcal vaccine uptake for older adults, encompassing 2,481,887 study participants (945 healthcare providers and 2,480,942 older adults) across seven countries. Examples of interventions that were associated with increased pneumococcal vaccination rate included periodic health examinations, reminders and decision-making tools built into electronic medical records, inpatient vaccination protocols, preventative health checklists, and multimodal educational interventions. When comparing the three pillars, prioiritization of vaccination schemes had the highest evidence for improved rates of vaccination (n = 14 studies), followed by primary care interventions (n = 8 studies), then information campaigns (n = 5 studies). CONCLUSION: Several promising interventions were associated with improved outcomes related to vaccine uptake, although controlled study designs are needed to determine which interventions are most effective.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kirubarajan A ; Lynch M ; Nasreen S ; Gebretekle GB ; Fadel SA ; Crowcroft NS ; Allin S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aged\r\nHumans\r\nDeveloped Countries\r\nElectronic Health Records\r\nImmunization Programs/methods\r\n*Pneumococcal Vaccines\r\n*Vaccination\r\nOlder adults\r\nPneumococcal\r\nSenior\r\nUptake\r\nVaccine\r\nVaccine hesitancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kirubarajan A, Lynch M, Nasreen S, Gebretekle GB, Fadel SA, Crowcroft NS, and Allin S (2023) Increasing pneumococcal vaccine uptake in older adults: a scoping review of interventions in high-income countries..

One reason for the low coverage is poor parental knowledge of the importance of completing vaccination schedules. We therefore assessed the effects on childhood vaccination coverage, of educating parents and other persons assuming the parental role. We prospectively registered the systematic review, published the protocol, and used standard Cochrane methods to collect and synthesise the evidence. We found six eligible randomised trials with 4248 participants. Three trials assessed health-facility based education of mothers on the importance of completing vaccination schedules; immediately after birth and three months later (one study) or during the first vaccination visit (two studies). The other trials assessed community-based education, including information campaigns on the importance of vaccines using audiotaped presentations and leaflet distributions (one study); structured group discussions on benefits and costs of childhood vaccination and local action plans for improving vaccine uptake (one study); and home-based information sessions using graphic cards showing benefits and costs of childhood vaccinations and location of vaccination centres (one study). Combining the data shows that these interventions lead to substantial improvements in childhood vaccination coverage (relative increase 36%, 95% confidence interval 14% to 62%). There was no difference between the effects of community-based and facility-based education. Therefore, education in communities and health facilities on the importance of childhood vaccinations should be integrated into all vaccination programmes in low and middle-income countries; accompanied by robust monitoring of impacts and use of data for action.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lukusa LA ; Ndze VN ; Mbeye NM ; Wiysonge CS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Child\r\nCommunity Participation\r\n*Developing Countries\r\nHealth Education/*methods\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization Schedule\r\nIncome\r\nMass Vaccination/economics/*methods\r\nParents/*education\r\nProgram Evaluation\r\nVaccination Coverage/economics/*methods\r\nChildhood vaccination\r\nEducation\r\ndemand creation\r\nlow and middle-income countries\r\nparents","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lukusa LA, Ndze VN, Mbeye NM, and Wiysonge CS (2018) A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of educating parents on the benefits and schedules of childhood vaccinations in low and middle-income countries..

This systematic review examined and appraised quality of interventions deemed effective to increase routine childhood immunization uptake in low SES populations in developed countries. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, CINAHL, EBMR, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Health STAR. We systematically searched and critically appraised articles published between January 1990 and December 2019 using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. This systematic review provides a synthesis of the available evidence for childhood immunization interventions deemed effective for low SES parents or families of children ≤ 5 years of age. SYNTHESIS: The search yielded 3317 records, of which 2975 studies met the inclusion criteria. From the 100 relevant studies, a total of 40 were included. The majority of effective and strongly rated studies synthesized consisted of multi-component interventions. Such interventions addressed access, community-based mobilization, outreach, appointment reminders, education, clinical tracking and incentives, and were language and health literacy appropriate to support low SES parents. Improving access to low SES parents was deemed effective in the vast majority of strongly rated studies. Incorrect contact information of low SES parents due to increased social mobility (i.e. household moves) rendered reminders ineffective, and therefore, updating contact information should be pursued proactively by front-line healthcare providers. In addition, plain language communication with low SES parents regarding immunization was deemed effective in improving immunization uptake. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive multi-component interventions including improved access, appointment reminders, education and precision health communication are effective for addressing health inequities in immunization coverage amongst marginalized populations. Most low SES parents still believe that the benefits of immunization outweigh the risks.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Machado AA ; Edwards SA ; Mueller M ; Saini V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Child\r\nDeveloped Countries\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization\r\nSocial Class\r\n*Vaccination\r\n*Vaccination Coverage\r\nAccess\r\nDeprivation\r\nHealth equity\r\nImmunization\r\nPrecision public health\r\nVaccine hesitancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Machado AA, Edwards SA, Mueller M, and Saini V (2021) Effective interventions to increase routine childhood immunization coverage in low socioeconomic status communities in developed countries: A systematic review and critical appraisal of peer-reviewed literature..

These peopleremain vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases, and are often already disadvantaged due to poverty, conflict, and lack of access to basic health services. Globally, more 22.7 million children are estimated to be zero- or missed-dose, of which an estimated 3.1 million (∼14 %) reside in Nigeria.We conducted a scoping review tosynthesize recent literature on risk factors and interventions for zero- and missed-dosechildren in Nigeria. Our search identified 127 papers, including research into risk factors only (n = 66); interventions only (n = 34); both risk factors and interventions (n = 18); and publications that made recommendations only (n = 9). The most frequently reported factors influencing childhood vaccine uptake were maternal factors (n = 77), particularly maternal education (n = 22) and access to ante- and perinatal care (n = 19); heterogeneity between different types of communities - including location, region, wealth, religion, population composition, and other challenges (n = 50); access to vaccination, i.e., proximity of facilities with vaccines and vaccinators (n = 37); and awareness about immunization - including safety, efficacy, importance, and schedules (n = 18).Literature assessing implementation of interventions was more scattered, and heavily skewed towards vaccination campaigns and polio eradication efforts.

Although most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, persistent infection with high-risk HPV types may results in diseases. Although there are currently three effective and safe prophylactic HPV vaccines that are used across the world, HPV vaccination coverage remains low. This review evaluates the effects of the interventions to improve HPV vaccination coverage. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and checked the reference lists of relevant articles for eligible studies. Thirty-five studies met inclusion criteria. Our review found that various evaluated interventions have improved HPV vaccination coverage, including narrative education, outreach plus reminders, reminders, financial incentives plus reminders, brief motivational behavioral interventions, provider prompts, training, training plus assessment and feedback, consultation, funding, and multicomponent interventions. However, the evaluation of these intervention was conducted in high-income countries, mainly the United States of America. There is, therefore, a need for studies to evaluate the effect of these interventions in low-and middle-income countries, where there is a high burden of HPV and limited HPV vaccination programs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mavundza EJ ; Iwu-Jaja CJ ; Wiyeh AB ; Gausi B ; Abdullahi LH ; Halle-Ekane G ; Wiysonge CS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"human papillomavirus\r\nprovider-oriented interventions\r\nrecipient-oriented interventions\r\nsystematic review\r\nvaccination coverage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mavundza EJ, Iwu-Jaja CJ, Wiyeh AB, Gausi B, Abdullahi LH, Halle-Ekane G, and Wiysonge CS (2021) A Systematic Review of Interventions to Improve HPV Vaccination Coverage..

However, non-consistent attendance for immunization appointments remains a global challenge to healthcare providers. Thus, innovative strategies are required to reach the last mile where technology could be effectively utilized to achieve better compliance with children immunization schedules. Therefore, the aim of the review was to systematically collect and summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of text message reminders on childhood vaccination. METHODS: This review was conducted according to a priori published protocol on PROSPERO. A systematic literature search of databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane/Wiley library, and Science direct) was conducted. Eligibility and risk of bias assessments were performed independently by two reviewers. PRISMA flow diagrams were used to summarize the study selection process. Taking into account the level of heterogeneity, a random effects model was used and risk ratios with their 95% CI were used to present the pooled estimates. To investigate the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis were also considered. In this review, publication bias was assessed statistically using Harbord test. RESULTS: A total of 1771 articles were searched. Out of those 1771 articles, 558 duplicated articles were removed. About 1213 articles were further screened, and finally, ten articles met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that there is a significant effect of text message reminders on childhood vaccination coverage (RR = 1.11; 95% CI 1.05-1.17) with a moderate level of heterogeneity (I(2) = 64.3%, P = 0.003). The results from the Harbord test suggested that there is no evidence for publication bias (P = 0.340). CONCLUSION: This review highlights the potential benefits of incorporating mobile text message reminders into the standard management of childhood immunizations, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Our review aimed to systematically collect and summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of interventions used to improve pertussis vaccination uptake in pregnant women. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, PMC and CINAHL. Before and after studies and those with a concurrent control group were considered for inclusion. Standardized effect sizes were described as the ratio of the odds to be vaccinated in the intervention group compared with the standard care group and absolute benefit increase (ABI) were calculated. RESULTS: Six studies were included in the review, of which three were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Strategies to improve uptake were focused on healthcare providers, pregnant women, or enhancing vaccine access. Healthcare provider interventions included provider reminder, education, feedback and standing orders. Interventions directed at pregnant women focused solely on education. Observational studies showed: (1) the provision of maternal pertussis vaccination by midwives at the place of antenatal care has improved uptake of pertussis vaccine during pregnancy from 20% to 90%; (2) introduction of an automated reminder within the electronic medical record was associated with an improvement in the pertussis immunization rate from 48% to 97%; (3) an increase in prenatal pertussis vaccine uptake from 36% to 61% after strategies to increase provider awareness of recommendations were introduced. In contrast to these findings, interventions in all three RCTs (2 involved education of pregnant women, 1 had multi-component interventions) did not demonstrate improved vaccination uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the existing research, we recommend incorporating midwife delivered maternal immunization programs at antenatal clinics, use of a provider reminder system to target unvaccinated pregnant women and include maternal pertussis immunization as part of standard antenatal care.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mohammed H ; McMillan M ; Roberts CT ; Marshall HS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Female\r\nHumans\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data\r\n*Pertussis Vaccine\r\nPregnancy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVaccination/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mohammed H, McMillan M, Roberts CT, and Marshall HS (2019) A systematic review of interventions to improve uptake of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy..

Digital gamification is a promising new approach to tackle this public health issue. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to assess the amount and quality of outcomes in studies evaluating gamified digital tools created to increase vaccine knowledge and uptake. METHODS: We searched for peer-reviewed articles published between July 2009 and August 2019 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Journal of Medical Internet Research, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX. Studies were coded by author, year of publication, country, journal, research design, sample size and characteristics, type of vaccine, theory used, game content, game modality, gamification element(s), data analysis, type of outcomes, and mean quality score. Outcomes were synthesized through the textual narrative synthesis method. RESULTS: A total of 7 articles met the inclusion criteria and were critically reviewed. Game modalities and gamification elements were diverse, but role play and a reward system were present in all studies. These articles included a mixture of randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and studies comprising quantitative and qualitative measures. The majority of the studies were theory-driven. All the identified gamified digital tools were highly appreciated for their usability and were effective in increasing awareness of vaccine benefits and motivation for vaccine uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative paucity of studies on this topic, this scoping review suggests that digital gamification has strong potential for increasing vaccination knowledge and, eventually, vaccination coverage.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Montagni I ; Mabchour I ; Tzourio C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"digital tools\r\ngamification\r\nscoping review\r\nvaccination\r\nvaccine hesitancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Montagni I, Mabchour I, and Tzourio C (2020) Digital Gamification to Enhance Vaccine Knowledge and Uptake: Scoping Review..

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve immunization coverage in low- and middle-income countries, including both published and unpublished reports. We evaluated the quality of included studies and extracted data on costs and incremental coverage. Where possible, we calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) to describe the efficiency of each intervention in increasing coverage. RESULTS: A total of 14 out of 41 full text articles reviewed met criteria for inclusion in the final review. Interventions for increasing immunization coverage included demand generation, modified delivery approaches, cash transfer programs, health systems strengthening, and novel technology usage. We observed substantial heterogeneity in costing methods and incompleteness of cost and coverage reporting. Most studies reported increases in coverage following the interventions, with coverage increasing by an average of 23 percentage points post-intervention across studies. ICERs ranged from $0.66 to $161.95 per child vaccinated in 2017 USD. We did not conduct a meta-analysis given the small number of estimates and variety of interventions included. CONCLUSIONS: There is little quantitative evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions for improving immunization coverage, despite this being a major objective for national immunization programs. Efforts to improve the level of costing evidence-such as by integrating cost analysis within implementation studies and trials of immunization scale up-could allow programs to better allocate resources for coverage improvement. Greater adoption of standardized cost reporting methods would also enable the synthesis and use of cost data.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Munk C ; Portnoy A ; Suharlim C ; Clarke-Deelder E ; Brenzel L ; Resch SC ; Menzies NA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Cost-Benefit Analysis\r\nDeveloping Countries/*economics\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization Programs/*economics/statistics & numerical data\r\nIncome/*statistics & numerical data\r\nInfant\r\nQuality Improvement\r\nVaccination Coverage/*economics/statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Munk C, Portnoy A, Suharlim C, Clarke-Deelder E, Brenzel L, Resch SC, and Menzies NA (2019) Systematic review of the costs and effectiveness of interventions to increase infant vaccination coverage in low- and middle-income countries..

Most of the children from developing countries are still not fully immunized due to multiple factors including lack of interventions, awareness, and financial constraints and due to limited resource. Conversely, this review has identified the effectiveness of interventions to increase the immunisation coverage among children of developing countries. METHODS: Systematic review by using PRISMA statement (\"preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses\") has been conducted in English. published articles on Pub Med, Scopus, Cochrane, Medline and ISI by searching keywords like immunizations, childhood vaccination and developing countries has been accessed. Only randomised controlled trial and quasi-experimental studies designs were included in the final analysis based on quality assessment by adopting the Down and Black checklist and finally pooled analysis was done by random effect model. This systematic review has been approved and registered by University of York. RESULTS: A total of 16,570 published articles were accessed and finally 10 fulfilled our criteria that were analysed and interpreted. It demonstrated that the interventions has shown significantly increase vaccine coverage for childhood cluster diseases (OR 2.136 and p <0.05).Furthermore, it has been proved that an effect was more prominent for DTP (OR 2.397 and p<0.05) and measles (OR 2.628 and p<0.05), not as much for polio (OR 2.284 and p>0.05) and full vaccination schedule (OR 1.342 and p>0.05).

Vaccination plays an important role in the prevention of influenza. Channels that improve vaccination adherence can play a vital part in improving patient care. This study seeks to inform the design and implementation of pharmacy interventions at scale on improving influenza vaccination rates. Aim of the review The aim of this study was to identify key success factors for effective pharmacy intervention design and implementation to improve vaccination acceptance rates in influenza. Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL was performed to find literature on influenza vaccinations delivered at pharmacies, pharmacist-delivered influenza vaccinations, or influenza vaccination campaigns originating in the pharmacy setting. A meta-analysis using a random effects model estimated the impact of pharmacy intervention on vaccination rates (assessed as relative risk [RR] and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]). Results A total of 1221 studies were found that met the search criteria, of which 12 were selected for the literature review following eligibility screening. A meta-analysis of studies that contained binary total population and vaccination rate data was conducted on 6 studies, including 3182 participants, the vaccination rate was 24% higher in those who used the pharmacy-based intervention compared with those who used standard care [RR (95% CI) 1.24 (1.05, 1.47)]. Two separate sensitivity analyses were run for the vaccination rate. In participants aged ≥ 65 years, the vaccination rate was 3% higher in those who received the pharmacy-based intervention compared with those who received standard care; however, this change was not significant [RR (95% CI) 1.03 (0.86, 1.24)]. Additionally, a qualitative review showed that more successful pharmacy-based interventions were those with the more active involvement of pharmacists in routine care. This included regular checkup of vaccine status, proactive conversations and recommendations about vaccination, and pharmacy-based immunization programs, with specific vaccination days. In-pharmacy communication rather than passive information, such as through leaflets and posters was also more effective. Conclusion Pharmacists can play a significant role to improve patient treatment, adherence, and outcomes associated with influenza vaccines. Once pharmacy-based immunization is established, proactive involvement of is key to ensure successful program implementation and results. Expanding access for pharmacists and pharmacy intervention to provide vaccinations may increase vaccination acceptance and could be a valuable intervention in patient care. Additional studies should consider high-risk populations to inform optimal design and implementation strategies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Murray E ; Bieniek K ; Del Aguila M ; Egodage S ; Litzinger S ; Mazouz A ; Mills H ; Liska J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Aged\r\n*Community Pharmacy Services\r\nHumans\r\n*Influenza Vaccines\r\n*Influenza, Human/prevention & control\r\n*Pharmacies\r\nPharmacists\r\n*Pharmacy\r\nVaccination\r\nAcceptance\r\nInfluenza\r\nPharmacist\r\nVaccine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Murray E, Bieniek K, Del Aguila M, Egodage S, Litzinger S, Mazouz A, Mills H, and Liska J (2021) Impact of pharmacy intervention on influenza vaccination acceptance: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis..

Current practice is for healthcare practitioners to advise pregnant women to accept these vaccinations at the relevant times unless contraindicated. Although vaccination levels in general in the UK are relatively high, from April 2018 to March 2019 pertussis vaccine coverage in pregnant women was 68.8%. Vaccination rates need to be actively maintained and ideally increased in the face of increasing vaccine scepticism and misinformation. In addition, certain population groups (such as some Gypsy, Roma and Travellers and migrants) have lower levels of vaccination than the general public and additional or different actions may be required to increase their vaccination rates. Reasons for low uptake may include poor access to healthcare services; inaccurate claims about safety and effectiveness, which are propagated on social media and can lead to doubts about vaccines; and insufficient capacity within the healthcare system for providing vaccinations. In addition, problems with the recording of vaccination status and identification of people who are eligible to be vaccinated may have contributed to this problem. This review aims to identify effective interventions to increase the uptake of pertussis vaccination for pregnant women. It was carried out as an additional piece of work because of the very limited number of studies of pregnant women that were identified as part of the planned work looking at interventions by type (for example, education interventions). The vaccination of interest was also widened to include influenza vaccination for the same reason. It follows the protocol and overarching review question detailed in Appendix A, which has been divided across several review documents by intervention type and is summarised and customised for pregnant women in Table 1. This work was carried out as a review of reviews.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Book, Whole","Authors":"","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":" (2022) Evidence review for interventions to increase the uptake of routine vaccines for pregnant women: Vaccine uptake in the general population: Evidence review F.

A number of strategies have been utilized in developing countries to ensure high community demand and equitable availability of urban immunization services; however, a synthesis of the literature on these strategies has not previously been undertaken. METHODS: We reviewed articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and 2013 that assessed interventions for improving routine immunization coverage in urban areas in low- and middle-income countries. We categorized the intervention in each study into one of three groups: (1) interventions aiming to increase utilization of immunization services; (2) interventions aiming to improve availability of immunization services by healthcare providers, or (3) combined availability and utilization interventions. We summarized the main quantitative outcomes from each study and effective practices from each intervention category. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified; 87% from the African, Eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asian regions of the World Health Organization (WHO). Six studies were randomized controlled trials, eight were pre- and post-intervention evaluations, and one was a cross-sectional study. Four described interventions designed to improve availability of routine immunization services, six studies described interventions that aimed to increase utilization, and five studies aiming to improve both availability and utilization of services. All studies reported positive change in their primary outcome indicator, although seven different primary outcomes indicators were used across studies. Studies varied considerably with respect to the type of intervention assessed, study design, and length of intervention assessment. CONCLUSION: Few studies have assessed interventions designed explicitly for the unique challenges facing immunization programs in urban areas. Further research on sustainability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of interventions is needed to fill this gap.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nelson KN ; Wallace AS ; Sodha SV ; Daniels D ; Dietz V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Africa\r\nAsia, Southeastern\r\nChild\r\nCities\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\n*Developing Countries\r\nHealth Education\r\nHealth Personnel\r\nHumans\r\n*Immunization Programs\r\nIncome\r\nPoverty Areas\r\n*Vaccination Coverage\r\nVaccines/administration & dosage\r\nImmunization\r\nSlum\r\nUrban\r\nVaccination","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nelson KN, Wallace AS, Sodha SV, Daniels D, and Dietz V (2016) Assessing strategies for increasing urban routine immunization coverage of childhood vaccines in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature..

The benefits of vaccination have been comprehensively proven; however, disparities in coverage persist because of poor health system management, limited resources, and parental knowledge and attitudes. Evidence suggests that health interventions that engage local parties in communication strategies improve vaccination uptake. As mobile technology is widely used to improve health communication, mobile health (mHealth) interventions might be used to increase coverage. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the available literature on the use of mHealth to improve vaccination in low- and middle-income countries with large numbers of unvaccinated children. METHODS: In February 2017, MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), Scopus, and Web of Science, as well as three health organization websites-Communication Initiative Network, TechNet-21, and PATH-were searched to identify mHealth intervention studies on vaccination uptake in 21 countries. RESULTS: Ten peer-reviewed studies and 11 studies from white or gray literature were included. Nine took place in India, three in Pakistan, two each in Malawi and Nigeria, and one each in Bangladesh, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. Ten peer-reviewed studies and 7 white or gray studies demonstrated improved vaccination uptake after interventions, including appointment reminders, mobile phone apps, and prerecorded messages. CONCLUSIONS: Although the potential for mHealth interventions to improve vaccination coverage seems clear, the evidence for such interventions is not. The dearth of studies in countries facing the greatest barriers to immunization impedes the prospects for evidence-based policy and practice in these settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oliver-Williams C ; Brown E ; Devereux S ; Fairhead C ; Holeman I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"cell phones\r\ncommunication\r\nglobal health\r\nmHealth\r\ntelemedicine\r\nvaccination","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oliver-Williams C, Brown E, Devereux S, Fairhead C, and Holeman I (2017) Using Mobile Phones to Improve Vaccination Uptake in 21 Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Systematic Review..

In witness to the increasing burden of HPV-related infections and cancers, research focused on the vaccination interventions should be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy and address the gap. The search was conducted through PubMed, Cochrane, and CINAL. Studies were included if they (1) included vaccination programs, (2) target population was young adults aged 17-26, (3) examined factors associated with the intervention effectiveness, (4) were published in English, and (5) were published between February 2010 and February 2020. HPV-related knowledge and intentions toward HPV vaccination were all reported increased after the intervention. Increased HPV vaccination intentions were found associated with the increased vaccine initiation and completion. Among bisexual or homosexual individuals, females were found more likely to complete the HPV dose 2 and 3. The review findings suggested using vaccination interventions incorporated with educational components to promote vaccine uptake among young adults. Supportive interventions tailored to different populations and settings are crucial to address the suboptimal HPV-related knowledge and vaccination status among the young beneficiaries.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ou L ; Youngstedt SD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nEducational Status\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice\r\nHumans\r\nIntention\r\n*Papillomavirus Infections/prevention & control\r\n*Papillomavirus Vaccines/therapeutic use\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care\r\nVaccination\r\nYoung Adult\r\nHuman papillomavirus vaccine\r\nImmunization programs\r\nPapillomavirus infection\r\nVaccination awareness\r\nVaccination coverage\r\nVaccination promotion\r\nYoung adults","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ou L, and Youngstedt SD (2022) The Role of Vaccination Interventions to Promote HPV Vaccine Uptake Rates in a College-Aged Population: a Systematic Review..

However, each year millions of children worldwide, mostly from low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), do not receive the full series of vaccines on their national routine immunisation schedule. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2011 and focuses on interventions for improving childhood immunisation coverage in LMICs. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies to boost and sustain high childhood immunisation coverage in LMICs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2016, Issue 4, part of The Cochrane Library . www.cochranelibrary.com, including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register (searched 12 May 2016); MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily and MEDLINE 1946 to Present, OvidSP (searched 12 May 2016); CINAHL 1981 to present, EbscoHost (searched 12 May 2016); Embase 1980 to 2014 Week 34, OvidSP (searched 2 September 2014); LILACS, VHL (searched 2 September 2014); Sociological Abstracts 1952 ‐ current, ProQuest (searched 2 September 2014). We did a citation search for all included studies in Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, 1975 to present; Emerging Sources Citation Index 2015 to present, ISI Web of Science (searched 2 July 2016). We also searched the two Trials Registries: ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 5 July 2016) Selection criteria Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT), non‐RCTs, controlled before‐after studies, and interrupted time series conducted in LMICs involving children aged from birth to four years, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Data collection and analysis We independently screened the search output, reviewed full texts of potentially eligible articles, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data in duplicate; resolving discrepancies by consensus. We then conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses and used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results Fourteen studies (10 cluster RCTs and four individual RCTs) met our inclusion criteria. These were conducted in Georgia (one study), Ghana (one study), Honduras (one study), India (two studies), Mali (one study), Mexico (one study), Nicaragua (one study), Nepal (one study), Pakistan (four studies), and Zimbabwe (one study). One study had an unclear risk of bias, and 13 had high risk of bias. The interventions evaluated in the studies included community‐based health education (three studies), facility‐based health education (three studies), household incentives (three studies), regular immunisation outreach sessions (one study), home visits (one study), supportive supervision (one study), information campaigns (one study), and integration of immunisation services with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria (one study). We found moderate‐certainty evidence that health education at village meetings or at home probably improves coverage with three doses of diphtheria‐tetanus‐pertussis vaccines (DTP3: risk ratio (RR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 2.59). We also found low‐certainty evidence that facility‐based health education plus redesigned vaccination reminder cards may improve DTP3 coverage (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.87). Household monetary incentives may have little or no effect on full immunisation coverage (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23, low‐certainty evidence). Regular immunisation outreach may improve full immunisation coverage (RR 3.09, 95% CI 1.69 to 5.67, low‐certainty evidence) which may substantially improve if combined with household incentives (RR 6.66, 95% CI 3.93 to 11.28, low‐certainty evidence). Home visits to identify non‐vaccinated children and refer them to health clinics may improve uptake of three doses of oral polio vaccine (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39, low‐certainty evidence). There was low‐certainty evidence that integration of immunisation with other services may improve DTP3 coverage (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.59). Authors' conclusions Providing parents and other community members with information on immunisation, health education at facilities in combination with redesigned immunisation reminder cards, regular immunisation outreach with and without household incentives, home visits, and integration of immunisation with other services may improve childhood immunisation coverage in LMIC. Most of the evidence was of low certainty, which implies a high likelihood that the true effect of the interventions will be substantially different. There is thus a need for further well‐conducted RCTs to assess the effects of interventions for improving childhood immunisation coverage in LMICs. Plain language summary Interventions that will increase and sustain the uptake of vaccines in low‐ and middle‐income countries What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to evaluate the effect of different strategies to increase the number of children in low‐and‐middle‐income countries who are vaccinated to prevent infection by a disease. Researchers in Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 14 relevant studies. Do strategies to improve childhood vaccination work? Giving information about vaccination to parents and community members, handing out specially designed vaccination reminder cards, offering vaccines through regular immunisation outreach with and without household incentives (rewards), identifying unvaccinated children through home visits and referring them to health clinics, and integrating vaccination services with other services may lead to more children getting vaccinated. However, offering parents money to vaccinate their children may not improve vaccination uptake. Most of these findings were of low‐certainty, and we need more well‐conducted research in this area. What was studied in the review? Millions of children in low‐and‐middle‐income countries still die from diseases that could have been prevented with vaccines. There are a number of reasons for this. Governments and others have tried different strategies to increase the number of children vaccinated. What are the main results of the review? The review authors found 14 relevant studies from Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Mali, Mexico, Nicaragua, Nepal, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe. The studies compared people receiving these strategies to people who only received the usual healthcare services. The studies showed the following: Giving information and discussing vaccination with parents and other community members at village meetings or at home probably leads to more children receiving three doses of diphtheria‐tetanus‐pertussis vaccine (moderate‐certainty evidence). Giving information to parents about the importance of vaccinations during visits to health clinics combined with a specially designed participant reminder card and integration of vaccination services with other health services may improve the uptake of three doses of diphtheria‐tetanus‐pertussis vaccine (low‐certainty evidence). Offering money to parents on the condition that they vaccinate their children may make little or no difference to the number of children that are fully vaccinated (low‐certainty evidence). Using vaccination outreach teams to offer vaccination to villages on fixed times monthly may improve coverage for full vaccination (low‐certainty evidence). How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for studies that were published up to May 2016.","Comments":"[Effective Practice and Organisation of Care]","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oyo‐Ita A ; Wiysonge CS ; Oringanje C ; Nwachukwu CE ; Oduwole O ; Meremikwu MM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Developing Countries\r\n*Health Education\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization [*statistics & numerical data]\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMotivation\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nReward","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oyo‐Ita A, Wiysonge CS, Oringanje C, Nwachukwu CE, Oduwole O, and Meremikwu MM (2016) Interventions for improving coverage of childhood immunisation in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify peer-reviewed studies published in English that reported interventions aimed at increasing immunization coverage and the associated costs and effectiveness of the interventions. We found limited information in the literature, with many studies reporting effectiveness estimates, but not providing cost information. Using the available data, we developed a cost function to support future programmatic decisions about investments in interventions to increase immunization coverage for relatively low and high-income countries. The cost function estimates the non-vaccine cost per dose of interventions to increase absolute immunization coverage by one percent, through either campaigns or routine immunization. The cost per dose per percent increase in absolute coverage increased with higher baseline coverage, demonstrating increasing incremental costs required to reach higher coverage levels. Future studies should evaluate the performance of the cost function and add to the database of available evidence to better characterize heterogeneity in costs and generalizability of the cost function.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ozawa S ; Yemeke TT ; Thompson KM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Bacterial Infections/economics/immunology/prevention & control\r\nBacterial Vaccines/administration & dosage/*economics\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis/methods\r\nDeveloped Countries/economics\r\nDeveloping Countries/economics\r\nHealth Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization Programs/economics\r\nIncome/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Models, Statistical\r\nVaccination/*economics/statistics & numerical data\r\nVaccination Coverage/*economics/statistics & numerical data\r\nViral Vaccines/administration & dosage/*economics\r\nVirus Diseases/economics/immunology/prevention & control\r\nCost\r\nEffectiveness\r\nIntervention\r\nReview\r\nVaccination","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ozawa S, Yemeke TT, and Thompson KM (2018) Systematic review of the incremental costs of interventions that increase immunization coverage..

This systematic review summarizes the existing literature on strategies to improve vaccination intent and uptake among adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to inform future implementation in various populations and contexts. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified through a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Libraries, as well as grey literature databases published between January 2010 and March 2021. The search was limited to studies in LMICs that evaluated adult vaccination interventions. Data were extracted from the included studies and evaluated against the World Health Organization's Behavioral and Social Drivers of Vaccination Framework. The National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools were used to evaluate study quality. RESULTS: The initial literature review identified 2,854 records, 22 of which met the inclusion criteria. The majority (n = 19 or 86%) of studies were from middle-income countries, with the remaining studies (n = 3 or 13%) set in low-income countries. The majority (15/22, 68%) of interventions were multi-component. 82% (18/22) of studies addressed thoughts and feelings, 59% (13/22) addressed social processes, and 73% (16/22) addressed practical issues. Five studies reported primary outcomes of vaccination intent, and the remaining 17 reported vaccine uptake. 36% (8/22) of the studies cited statistically significant positive intervention effects on vaccination intent or uptake. Few of the included studies (6/22, 27%) were RTCs, and most studies (15/22, 68%) were of poor study quality. The studies reporting the highest increase in vaccination intent and uptake were multi-component interventions that addressed all three determinants of vaccination. DISCUSSION: The results of this review highlight levers that can be used to encourage vaccine intent and uptake in the ongoing rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the deployment of other vaccines to adult populations in LMICs. Of the included studies, multicomponent interventions were most effective, mainly when targeting multiple determinants of vaccination.

These strategies include interventions in which information is aimed at larger groups in the community, for instance at public meetings, through radio or through leaflets. This is one of two reviews on communication interventions for childhood vaccination. The companion review focuses on face‐to‐face interventions for informing or educating parents. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or educate people about vaccination in children six years and younger. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and five other databases up to July 2012. We searched for grey literature in the Grey Literature Report and OpenGrey. We also contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. There were no language, date or settings restrictions. Selection criteria Individual or cluster‐randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series (ITS) and repeated measures studies, and controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies. We included interventions aimed at communities and intended to inform and/or educate about vaccination in children six years and younger, conducted in any setting. We defined interventions aimed at communities as those directed at a geographic area, and/or interventions directed to groups of people who share at least one common social or cultural characteristic. Primary outcomes were: knowledge among participants of vaccines or vaccine‐preventable diseases and of vaccine service delivery; child immunisation status; and unintended adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were: participants' attitudes towards vaccination; involvement in decision‐making regarding vaccination; confidence in the decision made; and resource use or cost of intervention. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed the references to identify studies for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed risk of bias in all included studies. Main results We included two cluster‐randomised trials that compared interventions aimed at communities to routine immunisation practices. In one study from India, families, teachers, children and village leaders were encouraged to attend information meetings where they received information about childhood vaccination and could ask questions. In the second study from Pakistan, people who were considered to be trusted in the community were invited to meetings to discuss vaccine coverage rates in their community and the costs and benefits of childhood vaccination. They were asked to develop local action plans and to share the information they had been given and continue the discussions in their communities. The trials show low certainty evidence that interventions aimed at communities to inform and educate about childhood vaccination may improve knowledge of vaccines or vaccine‐preventable diseases among intervention participants (adjusted mean difference 0.121, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.055 to 0.189). These interventions probably increase the number of children who are vaccinated. The study from India showed that the intervention probably increased the number of children who received vaccinations (risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.31; moderate certainty evidence). The study from Pakistan showed that there is probably an increase in the uptake of both measles (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.58) and DPT (diptheria, pertussis and tetanus) (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.29) vaccines (both moderate certainty evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the number of children who received polio vaccine (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05; low certainty evidence). There is also low certainty evidence that these interventions may change attitudes in favour of vaccination among parents with young children (adjusted mean difference 0.054, 95% CI 0.013 to 0.105), but they may make little or no difference to the involvement of mothers in decision‐making regarding childhood vaccination (adjusted mean difference 0.043, 95% CI ‐0.009 to 0.097). The studies did not assess knowledge among participants of vaccine service delivery; participant confidence in the vaccination decision; intervention costs; or any unintended harms as a consequence of the intervention. We did not identify any studies that compared interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or educate with interventions directed to individual parents or caregivers, or studies that compared two interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or educate about childhood vaccination. Authors' conclusions This review provides limited evidence that interventions aimed at communities to inform and educate about early childhood vaccination may improve attitudes towards vaccination and probably increase vaccination uptake under some circumstances. However, some of these interventions may be resource intensive when implemented on a large scale and further rigorous evaluations are needed. These interventions may achieve most benefit when targeted to areas or groups that have low childhood vaccination rates.’ Plain language summary Interventions aimed at communities for informing and/or educating about early childhood vaccination Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effect of informing or educating members of the community about early childhood vaccination. After searching for all relevant studies, they found two studies, published in 2007 and 2009. Their findings are summarised below. What are interventions aimed at communities for childhood immunisation? Childhood vaccinations can prevent illness and death, but many children do not get vaccinated. There are a number of reasons for this. One reason may be that families lack knowledge about the diseases that vaccines can prevent, how vaccinations work, or how, where or when to get their children vaccinated. People may also have concerns (or may be misinformed) about the benefits and harms of different vaccines. Giving people information or education so that they can make informed decisions about their health is an important part of all health systems. Vaccine information and education aims to increase people's knowledge of and change their attitudes to vaccines and the diseases that these vaccines can prevent. Vaccine information or education is often given face‐to‐face to individual parents, for instance during home visits or at the clinic. Another Cochrane Review assessed the impact of this sort of information. But this information can also be given to larger groups in the community, for instance at public meetings and women's clubs, through television or radio programmes, or through posters and leaflets. In this review, we have looked at information or education that targeted whole communities rather than individual parents or caregivers. The review found two studies. The first study took place in India. Here, families, teachers, children and village leaders were encouraged to attend information meetings where they were given information about childhood vaccination and could ask questions. Posters and leaflets were also distributed in the community. The second study was from Pakistan. Here, people who were considered to be trusted in the community were invited to meetings where they discussed the current rates of vaccine coverage in their community and the costs and benefits of childhood vaccination. They were also asked to develop local action plans, to share the information they had been given and continue the discussions with households in their communities. What happens when members of the community are informed or educated about vaccines? The studies showed that community‐based information or education: ‐ may improve knowledge of vaccines or vaccine‐preventable diseases; ‐ probably increases the number of children who get vaccinated (both the study in India and the study in Pakistan showed that there is probably an increase in the number of vaccinated children); ‐ may make little or no difference to the involvement of mothers in decision‐making about vaccination; ‐ may change attitudes in favour of vaccination among parents with young children; We assessed all of this evidence to be of low or moderate certainty. The studies did not assess whether this type of information or education led to better knowledge among participants about vaccine service delivery or increased their confidence in the decision made. Nor did the studies assess how much this information and education cost or whether it led to any unintended harms.","Comments":"[Consumers and Communication]","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saeterdal I ; Lewin S ; Austvoll‐Dahlgren A ; Glenton C ; Munabi‐Babigumira S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice\r\nChild\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nHealth Education [*methods]\r\nHumans\r\nIndia\r\nInfant\r\nInformation Dissemination [*methods]\r\nPakistan\r\nParents [*education]\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nVaccination [*statistics & numerical data]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saeterdal I, Lewin S, Austvoll‐Dahlgren A, Glenton C, and Munabi‐Babigumira S (2014) Interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or educate about early childhood vaccination.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions to improve the uptake of vaccines among children and adolescents. METHODS: We performed a literature search until December 2020. Eligible studies were identified using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, and other sources. We included studies conducted on children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years. Studies comprised of hospitalized children and those with comorbid conditions were excluded. Two authors independently performed the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Findings from 120 studies (123 articles), of which 95 were meta-analyzed, reveal that vaccination education may increase overall vaccination coverage by 19% (risk ratio [RR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.26), reminders by 15% (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.18), interventions for providers by 13% (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.19), financial incentives by 67% (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.40-1.99), and multilevel interventions by 25% (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.41). The impact of school-based clinics and policy and legislation on overall vaccination coverage is still uncertain, and no impact of a multicomponent intervention on overall vaccination coverage was found. CONCLUSIONS: Educational interventions, reminders, provider-directed interventions, financial incentives, and multilevel interventions may improve vaccination coverage among school-aged children and adolescents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Siddiqui FA ; Padhani ZA ; Salam RA ; Aliani R ; Lassi ZS ; Das JK ; Bhutta ZA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nChild\r\nHealth Education\r\nHumans\r\nMotivation\r\n*Vaccination\r\n*Vaccination Coverage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Siddiqui FA, Padhani ZA, Salam RA, Aliani R, Lassi ZS, Das JK, and Bhutta ZA (2022) Interventions to Improve Immunization Coverage Among Children and Adolescents: A Meta-analysis..

We compiled a list of all strategies and evaluated the quality of these studies using the QATSDD tool. Results: After a review of 241 citations, we included eight studies. These studies focused on a wide variety of vaccines and settings. Core strategies that support vaccine uptake include the importance of tailoring and targeting in both messaging and delivery of vaccines and tracking delivery of vaccines. Patient and provider education, reminders, feedback loops, community collaborations, immunization registries and use of a medical home were also identified as other strategies. Conclusion: Our findings highlight several useful core strategies, which can be used to promote vaccination coverage.

METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS electronic databases and relevant organizations were contacted, including the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), to identify studies meeting eligibility criteria. A pair of reviewers identified 27 randomized and non-randomized studies quantifying the effectiveness of any intervention for reducing MOV and 5 studies assessing the rate of MOV in Latin America. Results are reported narratively when criteria to pool results were not met, and the certainty of this evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Evidence suggests the rate of MOV in Latin America ranged from 5% to 37% with a pooled estimate of 17% (95% CI [9, 32]) (low certainty) and that monetary incentives to healthcare teams, training for healthcare teams on how to communicate with patients, and educational interventions for caregivers probably reduce MOV (moderate to very low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence supporting the implementation of any intervention as policy based only on the potential reduction of MOV without considering several factors, including costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tampi M ; Carrasco-Labra A ; O'Brien KK ; Velandia-González M ; Brignardello-Petersen R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Latin America\r\nVaccination\r\nimmunization\r\nvaccination coverage","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tampi M, Carrasco-Labra A, O'Brien KK, Velandia-González M, and Brignardello-Petersen R (2022) Systematic review on reducing missed opportunities for vaccinations in Latin America..

Providers, payers, and public officials have worked over the years to develop innovative solutions to rapidly and consistently bring new diagnostic tests and therapies to our patients. P4P has been instituted in various forms over the last 30 years. Vaccines are one of society's greatest public health innovations and vaccination programs provide a unique opportunity for P4P programs. We attempted to investigate the effect of P4P compensation model implementation on the vaccination rate. Methods: Utilizing a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to December 2018. Results: Nine articles were included with poor to moderate quality. Improvements in vaccination rates after implementation of P4P were statistically significant in 8 of 9 of studies. However, due to the heterogeneity of the methods used, we could not pool the data. Conclusion: The results of this systematic review indicate that the implementation of P4P programs can increase the vaccination rate. In recent times when it has become increasingly more popular not to vaccinate, implementing P4P becomes even more important if it is shown to be an effective tool in increasing vaccination rates.","Comments":"Accession Number: 137694581.

Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2013 that 49,000 deaths all over the world were caused by neonatal tetanus. Only as recently as the year 2000, neonatal tetanus was a public health problem in 59 countries, but since then it has been eliminated in 36 of the countries concerned. The objective of this piece of work, therefore, was to investigate which strategies intended to increase demand for vaccination are effective in increasing anti-tetanus vaccination coverage of women in Sub Saharan Africa. We searched the following electronic databases from January 1989 to July 2016: Medline, EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), The Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), WHOLIS (World Health Organization Library Database), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences) and contacted experts in the field. There were no restrictions to language or publication status. All study designs that could provide the information we sought were eligible, provided the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Critical appraisal of all identified citations was done independently by two authors to establish the possible relevance of the articles for inclusion in the review. Our search strategy yielded 191 records and after assessment for eligibility, 6 papers met the criteria for inclusion. In Ivory Coast, after reorganization, health workers said they were satisfied with the work environment and the care provided in 91% and 96% of cases, respectively. In Kenya, the main factors contributing to having sufficiently immunized part of the population against tetanus are lower birth order, higher household wealth index, women's employment, making joint health-related decisions with a partner, and higher number of antenatal care visits. Particularly in Ethiopia, compared with other member countries, the size of the unimmunized population, reporting quality, fragileness of the health system, resource limitation, and others deserve further concerted attention. In Nigeria, the prevalence of missed opportunities was 66%. The factors responsible for missed opportunities were; poor history taking, lack of knowledge of the current immunization schedule, dependence on physician referral for immunization and inefficient immunization records keeping system. In Nigeria, socio-logistic variables found to be important in Expanded Programme on Immunization implementations included scheduling, health staff attitude, intersectoral collaboration, and health education. Lack of community participation was also found to be a crucial constraining factor. There are many challenges to increase immunization coverage of tetanus vaccine for women. So far very few interventions addressing these challenges have been evaluated scientifically. Community mobilization interventions to change or impact beliefs and attitudes of women are absolutely needed. Additionally, improving accessibility, affordability, availability and accommodation of vaccination service venues will make them more attractive.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vouking MZ ; Tadenfok CN ; Ekani JME ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nPregnancy\r\nPrenatal Care/statistics & numerical data\r\nTetanus/epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nTetanus Toxoid/*administration & dosage\r\nVaccination/statistics & numerical data\r\nVaccination Coverage/*statistics & numerical data\r\nWorld Health Organization\r\nStrategies\r\nimmunization coverage\r\ntetanus vaccine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vouking MZ, Tadenfok CN, and Ekani JME (2017) Strategies to increase immunization coverage of tetanus vaccine among women in Sub Saharan Africa: a systematic review..

We conducted a literature review included English or Chinese literature carried out in mainland China, using PubMed, the Cochrane databases, Web of Knowledge, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang data, and other relevant databases. Nineteen articles about the effectiveness and impact of interventins on improving the coverage of hepatitis B vaccine were included. Strong or moderate evidence showed that reinforcing health education, training and supervision, providing subsidies for facility birth, strengthening the coordination among health care providers, and using out-of-cold-chain storage for vaccines were all important to improving vaccination coverage.We found evidence that community education was the most commonly used intervention, and out-reach programs such as out-of-cold chain strategy were more effective in increasing the coverage of vaccination in remote areas where the facility birth rate was respectively low. The essential impact factors were found to be strong government commitment and the cooperation of the different government departments. Public interventions relying on basic health care systems combined with outreach care services were critical elements in improving the hepatitis B vaccination rate in China. This success could not have occurred without exceptional national commitment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang S Smith, H; Peng Z Xu,B; Wang W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang S Smith, H, Peng Z Xu,B, and Wang W (2016) Increasing Coverage of Hepatitis B Vaccination in China.  , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":12557377,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":985977,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Both studies used text message reminders and education for preg\"\n\"A study examining child-\nhood immunization found a statistically significant increase\n(from 34.5% to 44.2%, ������ < 0.001) in the proportion of\nchildren receiving on-time vaccination after implementa-\ntion of a mobile application for improved patient records\nand automated text message app[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Watterson et.al (2015) Using mHealth to Improve Usage of Antenatal Care, Postnatal Care, and Immunization.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":12671690,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12625001,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12557431,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":985977,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"elf-reported intended or actual behavior change, including\nbringing theirchild forvaccines[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Watterson et.al (2015) Using mHealth to Improve Usage of Antenatal Care, Postnatal Care, and Immunization.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":12557434,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":985977,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"ll studies showed some evi- dence that themHealth intervention implemented had a pos- itive impact on patient or health worker behavior\"\n\"A study examining child- hood immunization found a statistically significant increase (from 34.5% to 44.2%, ������ < 0.001) in the proportion of children receiving on-time vaccination after implementa- tion of a mobile application for improved patient records and automated text message appointment reminders\"\n\"inally, a study using\nan mHealth application to improve records and to send\nreminders during a mass vaccination campaign found that\n92% of children visited at home following the campaign had\nreceived the measles vaccine [21].[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Watterson et.al (2015) Using mHealth to Improve Usage of Antenatal Care, Postnatal Care, and Immunization.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":12557504,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12557520,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12624992,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12669605,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12557388,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":985977,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"text message appointment reminders\"\n\"child was vaccinated on time) to\nbring their child for immunization [23].

Many of these technologies attempt to influence patients', caretakers', or health workers' behavior. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to determine what evidence exists for the effectiveness of mHealth tools to increase the coverage and use of antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC), and childhood immunizations through behavior change in low- and middle-income countries. The full text of 53 articles was reviewed and 10 articles were identified that met all inclusion criteria. The majority of studies used text or voice message reminders to influence patient behavior change (80%, n = 8) and most were conducted in African countries (80%, n = 8). All studies showed at least some evidence of effectiveness at changing behavior to improve antenatal care attendance, postnatal care attendance, or childhood immunization rates. However, many of the studies were observational and further rigorous evaluation of mHealth programs is needed in a broader variety of settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Watterson JL ; Walsh J ; Madeka I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\nImmunization/*statistics & numerical data\r\nPostnatal Care/*statistics & numerical data\r\nPrenatal Care/*statistics & numerical data\r\nTelemedicine/*methods","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Watterson JL, Walsh J, and Madeka I (2015) Using mHealth to Improve Usage of Antenatal Care, Postnatal Care, and Immunization: A Systematic Review of the Literature..

Influenza vaccine during pregnancy offers 3-for-1 benefits to pregnant women, fetuses and newborn infants. Current vaccination uptake rates during pregnancy, however, are often lower than other high-risk groups and the general population. METHODS: We systematically reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to improve influenza vaccination coverage in pregnant women. Risk differences (RDs) were calculated from the included studies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the review, of which four were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Three cohort studies assessed provider-focused interventions while four RCTs and one cohort study evaluated pregnant women-focused interventions. Two cohort studies and a prospective intervention study assessed the effectiveness of bundled interventions. No study solely assessed the effectiveness of interventions to enhance access to influenza vaccination. One moderate quality RCT showed that an influenza pamphlet, with or without a verbalized benefit statement, improved the vaccination rate (RD=0.26; RD=0.39). The other reviewed RCTs showed discordant results, with RDs ranging from -0.15 to 0.03. Although all observational studies significantly improved vaccination rates (RDs ranged from 0.03 to 0.44), the quality of the evidence varied. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of effective interventions to increase the influenza vaccination rate in pregnant women. Based on the existing research, we recommend that clinicians provide influenza pamphlets to pregnant women with a verbalized statement about the benefits of influenza vaccine to newborns. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to develop successful maternal influenza vaccination programs. Increased clarity in reporting the content of interventions would help to improve the comparability and generalizability of the published studies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wong VW ; Lok KY ; Tarrant M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nBehavior Therapy/*methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfluenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage\r\nInfluenza, Human/*prevention & control\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Patient Acceptance of Health Care\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications, Infectious/*prevention & control\r\nProspective Studies\r\nVaccination/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data\r\nYoung Adult\r\nFlu\r\nImmunization\r\nInfant\r\nInfluenza\r\nIntervention\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnant women\r\nStrategies\r\nVaccine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wong VW, Lok KY, and Tarrant M (2016) Interventions to increase the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination among pregnant women: A systematic review..

remains one of the most effective public health interventions offering protection for children from vaccine preventable diseases. However, many children living in low- and- middle income countries do not get adequate immunization due to several factors. Mobile phone reminder interventions have shown great potential in enhancing a number of immunization outcomes. However, the evidence supporting its use in these countries is vague. This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence for mobile phone reminder in enhancing immunization uptake, completeness and timeliness. This review was conducted in accordance to the PRISMA recommendations. Three online databases; PubMed, Cochrane Library and African Journals Online, were systematically searched for potentially relevant studies. Screening of records (titles/abstracts from and full-texts) was done using Covidence. Meta-analyses were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (v5.4). The GRADEpro was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence/summary of findings. Eleven RCTs assessing immunization uptake, completeness and/or timeliness by means of SMS, phone calls or a combination of voice message and SMS were included in both quantitative and qualitative synthesis. Overall, the included studies were of moderate quality. Majority of the included studies indicated that mobile phone reminders were beneficial. Meta-analyses indicated that using mobile phone reminder interventions for the review outcomes was of variable effect with high level of heterogeneity. A combination of voice message and SMS has a greater effect followed by phone calls then SMS reminders for immunization completeness. The use of SMS for immunization uptake and timeliness were largely insignificant (p > 0.05). Furthermore, evidence to support the efficacy of mobile phone reminder from the GRADE synthesis was between low and moderate. Mobile phone reminders, particularly a combination of voice message + SMS and perhaps phone calls appears to be more effective in enhancing immunization outcomes. However, more studies are required in view of methodological inadequacies in existing studies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yunusa U ; Garba SN ; Umar AB ; Idris SH ; Bello UL ; Abdulrashid I ; Mohammed J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"*Cell Phone\r\nChild\r\nDeveloping Countries\r\nHumans\r\nImmunization\r\nReminder Systems\r\n*Text Messaging\r\nChild health\r\nImmunization outcomes\r\nLMICs\r\nMobile phone intervention\r\nReminder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yunusa U, Garba SN, Umar AB, Idris SH, Bello UL, Abdulrashid I, and Mohammed J (2021) Mobile phone reminders for enhancing uptake, completeness and timeliness of routine childhood immunization in low and middle income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis..
